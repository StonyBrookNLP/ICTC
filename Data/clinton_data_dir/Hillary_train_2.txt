i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is.

we are not going to privatize the ., we’re going to reform it.

too many african american families are mourning. too many young black men and women have been taken from us.
the republican party is now the party of trump. here's what it stands for.  7-4936-87bb-9cedcffe7ca8 …
here's what we can't afford: a republican in the white house.
he's taken the republican party a long way, from 'morning in america’ to 'midnight in america.’  on trump
the republican party platform is so hateful, you'd think donald trump wrote it himself.
1) this shouldn't be a debate about who gets to define "progressive"—it should be about who will get real results for american families.
young people face tough challenges, but they have the ability to do something about it: vote.
we need a leader on women's health—not just somebody who votes right, but somebody who leads the effort.

hillary's gun violence prevention plan supports legislation to stop convicted stalkers from possessing guns.
our service members and their families deserve more than empty words. let's give them the support they need:
enough with the bigotry and bombast. donald trump's not offering real change, he’s offering empty promises.

we have more to do for equality. we're going to fight for lgbt rights, women's rights, voting rights, workers' rights—and more.
civil rights & voting rights. worker’s rights & women’s rights. lgbt rights and rights for people with disabilities. let's defend them all.
i know we can protect our rights: women’s rights, gay rights, voting rights, immigrants' rights, workers' rights. 
words that ring truer than ever today: "human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights."
donald trump is more concerned with pandering to the gun lobby than keeping families safe.

our veterans and their families deserve a president who doesn't disrespect and disparage their sacrifices.
today, the sacrifices of gold star families weigh heavier on my mind. thank you. i will fight to get you the care & benefits you deserve. 
our service members and their families deserve more than empty words. let's give them the support they need:

this is just common sense. it's time for congress to act.
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”

hillary in new york yesterday:
"let him tell that to the fast food workers marching in the streets for better pay. they don’t need a lecture—they need a raise."
so excited to see @katyperry —but while we wait, she's taking over hillary's instagram!
i’ve been called a lot of things over the years, but ‘unqualified’ has not been one of them. 
this should go without saying: taking nuclear war lightly is disqualifying for anyone seeking to be president of the united states.
repeating the specific words 'radical islamic terrorism' is just a distraction...our priority should be how to fight the enemy.

let's send donald trump—and the world—a clear message.
immigration is good for america. immigration built our country.  at @ushcc
consulting with an important advisor at the fourth of july parade in gorham, nh.
fixing our immigration system will strengthen families, our economy, and our country.
comprehensive immigration reform will strengthen families, our economy, and our country.
hillary wants to fix our immigration system so we can keep families together.
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
...and while we're at it...
start spreading the news.
donald trump says he wants to make america great again—well, he could start by actually making things in america again. 
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
there's only one candidate in this race with more votes than donald trump.
no one can get this done alone—not even the president of the united states. it’s got to be the mission of our entire nation.
trump appears to have broken the law and acted against our nation's interest, all so he could line his own pockets.
my opponent has america all wrong. there’s nothing we can’t do when we come together as one nation. 
we "can’t sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need. we must choose resolve—and we must lead the world to meet this threat."
my view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead.  in florida
to all of your supporters here and around the country: i want you to know, i've heard you.  on @berniesanders
we are americans. we will not turn on each other or our principles. that's how we win.
this isn't who we are, and it also isn't how we keep america safe.
i believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should. 
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
trump's attacks on women's health are just as bad as the rest of the gop candidates'.
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.

we need a fighter for children and families in the white house.
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is.

anyone who looks at the african american community and sees only poverty, crime, and despair is missing so much.

our rising generation of young americans is the most open, diverse, and connected we’ve ever seen.
as of tonight, only one thing is standing between donald trump and the presidency: all of us. get your free sticker:
we need to protect and build on @potus ' progress.
we need to work to make sure that we give every child in america the same opportunities.
these things can be true at once: we need criminal justice reform. we need to support police. we need to do more to stop gun violence.
we need more love and kindness in this country...the last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are. 
yes, we need to crack down on wall street—but that's not enough. we need to go after corporations that hurt families.

if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
in america, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you.
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
nobody here was “having fun” except for trump.
trump is right about one thing.
hope you have this much fun this weekend.
i'm running for president. everyday americans need a champion, and i want to be that champion. –h
every day, donald trump proves that he’s not in this for the american people. he’s in it for himself. 
trump prioritizing his own gain over americans' well-being isn't new, but it is telling: the only person he'll fight for is himself.
trump's statements are lies—but he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
"i do wish donald would listen to other people once in a while. he might actually learn something. but...he only listens to himself."
here's your must-read of the day:
i will miss my friend  . truly a  .
we love you back, @potus .
what happened in flint would never have happened in a wealthy, white suburb of detroit. 
we need a president with the experience and expertise to lead in the world and keep america safe. that's hillary.
the brave men and women who have served our country deserve better than donald trump.
a day to remember.
a president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country. 
our fallen heroes deserve our profound gratitude for giving their lives to protect our freedom, today and every day.  
fighting  is critical to protecting our environment, powering our economy & safeguarding our country.

hillary on the faith that drives her: "do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can."
as we methodists like to say: do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can. 
"i never said that." —donald trump, who said that.   p/status/265895292191248385 …
even before his hateful speech this week, trump has never been vague about his feelings toward immigrants.
in america, we’re always stronger together.
in america, we're always stronger together.
when we work together, we will trump hate.
we have to decide whether we’re going to work together so we can all rise together. 
it’s a simple but powerful idea. we are fairer together. we are better together. we are stronger together.
quality time in ames, iowa.
hillary in new york yesterday:
5 days to iowa!
crowds filling in at roosevelt island:
economists project that trump’s plans would add more than $5,000,000,000,000 to the national debt. that's "trillion" with a "t."
hillary has spent her career fighting for families:

hillary has spent decades fighting for veterans, members of the military, and their families.
the "winners" from last night's  :
@potus nice job last night. aunt hillary approves.  
last night, we put the biggest crack yet in that highest, hardest glass ceiling. here are the highlights:
in case you missed it last night
“even if people don’t vote for me in november, i’m going to be for them and for you every single day.”
not a single living president has endorsed donald trump.
time to  ! call 3 hillary supporters in nh and remind them to vote on tuesday. you don't even need a !
yeah, @berniesanders —she's got a *bit* of experience.
it's not brain surgery: republicans tend to be a bit more truth-y when the presidency isn't on the line.
i’m pleased to announce a nationwide drive to get 3 million people to register to vote and commit to vote in this election. 
when donald trump goes low...register to vote:
“when i vote, it is about my family. and when i vote in this election, it’s absolutely about my daughter.”  9-4db2-bdda-ff88de51c731 …
take it from @flotus : this election is too important to sit out. register to vote:
as @flotus said, this election is about what kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations.
we need to pay our teachers like the future of our country is in their hands—because it is.
we need ideas, not insults. plans, not paranoia. we can’t let @potus 's legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn’t understand that.
let’s be clear: islam isn't our enemy. hateful rhetoric against muslims isn't just wrong—it plays into terrorists' hands.
"progress is on the ballot. tolerance is on the ballot. democracy is on the ballot. justice is on the ballot."
a lot of people are saying donald trump is a conspiracy theorist...
this is big. we just won florida!
welcome to the race, gov. o'malley. looking forward to discussing strong families and communities. 
president obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done. 
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
president obama doesn't get the credit he deserves. his accomplishments shouldn't be up for debate at a  .

every day, donald trump proves that he’s not in this for the american people. he’s in it for himself. 
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
trump says he hires the best people. this is what he means:
he doesn’t speak for immigrants...i don’t think he speaks for women. i don’t think he speaks for working families.  on trump

"there may be some new voices in the republican presidential choir, but they're all singing the same old song. a song called 'yesterday.'"
"when all americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our country’s prosperity—that’s fair growth."
it’s hard to keep track of all of the ignorant and divisive things trump and pence have said—so we did it for you.
"they want to put immigrants who work hard and pay taxes at risk of deportation."
good for you, jensen. every woman deserves equal pay, no matter what her age. keep up the hard work—and courage!  
when you work hard, you should not be living in poverty.
"it's about time this country had somebody running it who has an idea about money." —trump
i want this election to be about something, not just against somebody.  in iowa:
"i ask you to do for hillary clinton what you did for me. i ask you to carry her the same way you carried me.”
every future president needs one.
say you’re on team  :
10. how did the russian mob boss who ran a criminal organization out of trump tower get a vip pass to your miss universe pageant in moscow?
we should build a path to citizenship, not a wall on the border.
“what i’ve laid out is a path forward that will keep us safer...and go after the terrorists to finally destroy them"
a four-year college should not be the only path to a middle-class life:
"we can’t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship."
if you like donald trump, you’re going to love his choice for vice president.

"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
"president trump" would undo so much of the progress we’ve made over the past 8 years under president obama. we can't let that happen.
50 gop national security experts said they will not vote for trump because he would be “the most reckless president in american history.”
this is what it would be like for a former secretary of state to be president:
45 reasons why trump should never be president—just from this week alone.
imagine if this was our president.
this country belongs to all of us—not just to those at the top. not just to people who look one way, worship one way, or even think one way.
"i know what it's like to go into the primaries up. and i know what it's like to come out of them down."
we’re not just going to break the glass ceiling. we’re going to break down all the barriers that hold back women and their families.
it's past time for politicians to respect women's right to make their own health decisions.
it’s not just that trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to national security. his words are dangerous, and they hurt us.
i've never known america to quit on ourselves. i've never known us to give up in the face of tough challenges. 
well done, ireland. 
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump.

step 1: commit to vote or caucus for hillary →  step 2: tell the world with your own card
congrats, cedrick—what an achievement for you, your family, and your teacher!  
this is what @realdonaldtrump would do to your state's economy.
we need a supreme court that will protect our rights—not corporations' right to buy elections. that's what's at stake.
it's absurd that people with suspected terrorist links can buy a gun in america, no questions asked.
bottom line: when women get ahead, america gets ahead.
it is not enough to be on the money. you need to be making the money.  on ensuring equal pay for women

agreed, president @billclinton !
republicans who want to repeal the aca should try telling that to the 18 million people who have health coverage because of it.

so pleased & proud to see mayor @billdeblasio sworn in today. mt @billclinton : what a great day for nyc!
what trump really means when he says "make america great again”:
it's great to be back on the campaign trail.
my view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead.  in florida
our first-ever gold medal-winning women's gymnastics team: the magnificent seven.
i want to thank bernie sanders. bernie, your campaign inspired millions of americans. 
a bernie sanders supporter asked hillary a questionere’s what he thought of her response:
this is the only comprehensive plan from a presidential candidate to support families with autism:
anyone who wants to be president should have a plan to make a real difference for americans with autism.
50 gop national security experts said they will not vote for trump because he would be “the most reckless president in american history.”
this is what it would be like for a former secretary of state to be president:
remember: if he becomes president, donald trump would have the . economy in his hands.
we asked senator @clairecmc what a republican president would mean for women.
many people are saying trump won't release his tax returns because he's hiding something. what do you think it is?
lots of love in south carolina.
we did it, south carolina.
the results are in: we won north carolina!
to south carolina, to the volunteers at the heart of our campaign, to the supporters who power it: thank you.

donald trump is not who we are.

hillary believes that what’s good for women is good for america.
"she has so much compassion and it shows. she's a person, she's a grandmother, she's somebody's mother."
4) hillary's not running to make a point—she's running to make a difference. she'll keep doing that. please feel free to keep tweeting.
we’ve come too far to let republicans take us back. the fight for women’s reproductive rights is far from over.
watch this before you watch tonight's debate.
in orlando and san bernardino, terrorists used assault weapons like the ar-15 to kill americans. we should make it harder for them to do so.
we need to stop terrorists from getting the weapons they need to carry out attacks.
this young man’s story about depression is exactly why we can’t repeal or replace the affordable care act.
makes it clear. there's only one thing standing between republicans & repeal of the affordable care act: a democratic president.
"when all americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our country’s prosperity—that’s fair growth."
when you work hard, you should not be living in poverty.
hillary wants to change how we think about business.
hillary clinton called out republicans for slamming the door on syrian refugees: “we’re better than that.”
trump's attacks on women's health are just as bad as the rest of the gop candidates'.

(the "f" doesn't stand for "friends")
we need a president who can take on republicans and get the job done.
there are six republicans left in the race for the white house—and we can’t afford to let any of them near it.
i agree with bernie. focus must be on helping america's middle class. gop would hold them back. i welcome him to the race. –h
we should remove barriers so we can focus on the important things: supporting employees, doing good work, & contributing to our communities.
we want a fair race. let's get back to the issues the american people care about.
are you a republican who thinks @realdonaldtrump should not become president? tell us why:
donald trump could be our next commander-in-chief. here's who thinks that's a good idea.
anybody who thinks that they can influence what i will do doesn't know me very well. 
donald trump considers his shuttered casinos a success because he made millions. a man who thinks that way has no business being president.
now we know what trump really thinks about us. sad!

trump is right about one thing.
we did it, new york! watch hillary live:
america has always been a country of "we," not "me." and we've always been stronger together.
i’ve been called a lot of things over the years, but ‘unqualified’ has not been one of them. 
a day to remember.
. @realdonaldtrump : barack obama is your president too.
no, barack obama is not the founder of isis.
this is it—the  is today! if you’re standing with hillary, rt to say  .
barack obama is our president. he has a constitutional responsibility to fill [the supreme court] vacancy. he has exercised it. 
he doesn’t speak for immigrants...i don’t think he speaks for women. i don’t think he speaks for working families.  on trump
if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
in a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside-in and the inside-out.
we have to do more to raise wages & support paid leave for hardworking families. i stand with @raise_up_wa in their work to do just that. 
new yorkers have always believed that if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. 
i want every young person in america to know that if you work hard, you can get ahead, and i want america to have your back. in nh

if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
donald trump has a problem looking at someone different from himself and actually seeing them.

hillary on the situation in  .
the good news is that my pneumonia finally got some republicans interested in women’s health. 
getting ready to make some history.
we watched the first night of the  so you didn't have to. some of the worst of what we heard:
"i pledged that...every one [of the accountability review board's recommendations] would be on the way to implementation. and they were."
let’s not forget that there are lots of flints out there. places where poor people and people of color have been left out and left behind.
"above all, we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country."
"they turn their backs on gay people who love each other."
to be be great, we can’t be small. we can’t lose what made america great in the first place.
"together we’re going to build an america where...a father can tell his daughter, 'you can be anything you want to be—including president.'"
wall street can never be allowed to wreck main street again. no bank can be too big to fail and no executive can be too powerful to jail.
when we join together, we can’t be beat. say you’re on team  :

trump can't win tonight's debate by lying to the american people.
today’s the day! as south carolina heads to the polls, let hillary know you're with her.
to be be great, we can’t be small. we can’t lose what made america great in the first place.
i’m proud of the experience and judgment i would bring to this job. a president has to be able to do all parts of the job. 
an idea you won't hear at the  : if you work hard, you should be able to succeed—no matter who you are or where you come from.

if you're with hillary, now is the time to stand up and say so. if you can, pitch in to show her you’re with her:
i believe with all my heart that america is better than this. america is better than donald trump. 
we are better than this.
the brave men and women who have served our country deserve better than donald trump.
my thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and wounded, and all the people of belgium. 
women earn just $0.79 for every $1 men do. that's a problem for all of us.

here are 35 questions trump still needs to answer.
hillary stands up for planned parenthood—and women's rights.
racial profiling is demeaning, wrong, and unconstitutional. it's time to put that practice behind us.
2.7 million americans turn to planned parenthood every year for health care. proud to  .
hillary has always stood with planned parenthood—and always will.
the force is strong with this one.
if we're going to get into labels, it wasn't very progressive to vote against the brady bill five times, and immigration reform.
living without discrimination should be a right for all, not a privilege for some. hear hear, @abbywambach .
@tusk81 what wonderful news to hear you're cancer-free. what a great way to start the new year. now have that glass of wine! 
new york is home to 20 million people. we don’t all look the same. we don’t all sound the same or worship the same, but we pull together.
we don't all look the same, or sound the same, or worship the same—and that's one of america's biggest strengths.  b-41d7-98c6-5f5c7d40fd83 …
"i ask you to do for hillary clinton what you did for me. i ask you to carry her the same way you carried me.”
americans with disabilities deserve the chance to work alongside those without disabilities—to do the same jobs for the same pay & benefits.
if donald trump doesn't show all americans the respect they deserve, he doesn't deserve to be their president.
we can't accept this as "normal."
donald trump is unqualified and totally unfit to be commander-in-chief. you can stop him. register to vote today:
there is no doubt in my mind that donald trump is unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief. 
there's only one candidate in this election who's ready to be america's commander-in-chief.
there's one candidate who's ready to be commander-in-chief on day one.
hillary is the candidate in this race with the experience to be commander-in-chief. text qualified to 47246 if you agree.
he’s always doing that.
republicans have a lot of nice things to say—when it's not an election year. thanks, mayor giuliani.
tim is everything donald trump & mike pence are not…he is a progressive who likes to get things done. that’s just my kind of guy. 
donald trump is not who we are.
when it comes to women's health, there are two kinds of experts: women and their doctors. true 40+ years ago, true today. 
corporations have to do right by their communities and our country. too many aren’t holding up their end of the bargain.
"what kind of a man roots for an economic crash that cost millions of people their jobs? their homes? their life savings?" —warren on trump
we lost many brave americans on september 11, 2001—and in the years since, because of it. today we mourn and honor them. 
too many americans living with mental illness have been left to face it on their own.
well done, ireland. 
we know all too well who donald trump is. let's make sure he never becomes president:
with a mother in the oval office, we may finally catch up to the rest of the world on paid leave.
i want this election to be about something, not just against somebody.  in iowa:
we need to help students who are also parents. when you help parents get an education, you're also helping their children.
you can’t just talk someone into trusting you. you’ve got to earn it ... i believe what you say matters. 
stick it to trump with the official  sticker.
economists project that trump’s plans would add more than $5,000,000,000,000 to the national debt. that's "trillion" with a "t."
i think the president's job is to do everything possible—everything she can do—to lift up the people of this country. 
everything you need to know before watching tonight's debate:
in 2016, everything we’ve accomplished together is on the line.
a president should do everything she can not just to protect reproductive rights, but to advance them.
not being able to vote yet isn’t stopping 17-year-old patrick from doing everything he can to elect hillary.
president obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done. 
pres. obama doesn't get the credit he deserves for the job he's done...i want to build on that progress—but i want to go further. 
barack obama said progress is on the ballot this november. this economic data shows he’s right.
president obama doesn't get the credit he deserves. his accomplishments shouldn't be up for debate at a  .
president obama doesn't get the credit he deserves for strengthening our economy. we need to build on that progress, not go backwards.
mike pence introduced himself to america last night. here's what we learned—and what he forgot to mention:
i want every young person in america to know that if you work hard, you can get ahead, and i want america to have your back. in nh
as a smart man once said, there’s nothing wrong with america that can’t be fixed by what is right with america. 
hillary at tonight’s  :

a quarter of renters in the . spend more than half their income on rent. we need to make housing more affordable.

hillary opposes the keystone pipeline. read why:
most people who are bullies grow out of it. donald trump hasn't.
comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together, and it’s the right thing to do. 
america grows when american workers’ paychecks grow.
we’re going to make our economy grow, but we’re also going to make it fair. here’s how:
watch live: hillary’s speaking in ohio on her plans to create jobs and grow our economy:
if you want to know what someone’s really like, ask his neighbors when he's not around.
at our best, america has united behind the ideal that everyone deserves a fair shot. at its best, the supreme court has defended that ideal.
thank you, president carter.
donald trump chose one of the most anti-lgbt politicians in the country to be his vice president.
remember: if he becomes president, donald trump would have the . economy in his hands.
50 gop national security experts said they will not vote for trump because he would be “the most reckless president in american history.”
"he is a progressive who likes to get things done. that’s just my kind of guy." –hillary on @timkaine
tim is everything donald trump & mike pence are not…he is a progressive who likes to get things done. that’s just my kind of guy. 
i’m a progressive who likes to get things done. and i’ve learned that you have to be both a dreamer and a doer.  in nh
"this is ny. nobody dreams bigger than we do. but this is a city that likes to get things done. that’s what we want from our president too."
this shouldn't have to be said: you don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. it doesn’t work. no one buys it.
under trump's tax plan, the wealthiest 0.1% of americans would get more tax relief than the bottom 60% combined.
trump’s tax plan could give his own family a $4 billion tax break. here's what we could do with that money instead:
trump wants to eliminate the estate tax. what that would mean: his family gets a $4 billion tax cut. 99.8% of americans get nothing.
we should make the tax system fairer: close loopholes for wall street money managers and millionaires and give the middle class a tax break.
trump's called for a new tax loophole—the trump loophole. he'd pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies.
as hillary takes the stage at the  tonight, let her know you’re with her:
. @quora asked: "how close are we to a cure for alzheimer’s?" a cure could be possible by 2025.
we need to start listening to each other. hearing each other. walking in each other’s shoes.
no one gets through life alone. we have to look out for each other and lift each other up. 
none of us gets through life alone. we all have to look out for each other and lift each other up.
we are stronger when we respect each other, listen to each other, and act with a sense of common purpose. 
let’s be more than allies to each other. let’s take on each other’s struggles as our own. 
wishing everyone the best this kwanzaa. to all celebrating—bill and i send you our warmest wishes.

"americorps is a...cost-effective solution to some of our nation’s most pressing issues." hillary wants to expand it:

one moment last night that proved—again—that hillary's the only candidate ready to lead on the global stage:
america needs strong, smart, steady leadership. the last thing we need are leaders who incite more fear.
we need a president who can provide leadership that’s strong, smart, and steady. the last thing we need are leaders who incite more fear.

there’s no doubt about it—donald trump is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the united states.
donald trump is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief. 
"you figured out how to make it work. and now people are beginning to think about the future again."
hate isn't an american value.
trump is running a cynical campaign—trafficking in hate and fear, and playing to our worst instincts. we're better than this.
he doesn’t speak for immigrants...i don’t think he speaks for women. i don’t think he speaks for working families.  on trump
tell donald trump: hate is not an american value.
“i don’t think president obama & vice president biden get the credit they deserve for saving the american economy.”
we watched the first night of the  so you didn't have to. some of the worst of what we heard:
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
if we reach for love and kindness instead of bluster and bigotry, we can see the best in each other, not the worst. 
hillary never backs down from a tough fight—even if it's with some of the worst human rights offenders in the world.
hillary: “i’m excited to be here and i'm really excited about starting a campaign by talking to the people who really have a stake in it.”
donald trump is not who we are.

important words from someone who found refuge in america:
we need a president who will provide leadership that’s strong, smart, and steady. the last thing we need are leaders who incite more fear.
we need a president who can provide leadership that’s strong, smart, and steady. the last thing we need are leaders who incite more fear.

"elections have consequences. the president has a responsibility to nominate a new justice and the senate has a responsibility to vote."
having a good job is about so much more than getting a paycheck. it’s about dignity and a sense of purpose. 
we are stronger when we respect each other, listen to each other, and act with a sense of common purpose. 
this is just common sense. it's time for congress to act.
when we come together—all of us—with a sense of shared purpose and shared humanity, we can solve any problem and heal any divide. 
hillary’s work “was an important part of the reason their lives were better.”

no one gets through life alone. we have to look out for each other and lift each other up. 
let’s be more than allies to each other. let’s take on each other’s struggles as our own. 
in america, we don’t tear each other down, we lift each other up. we build bridges, not walls.

i think the president's job is to do everything possible—everything she can do—to lift up the people of this country. 
hillary will defend president obama’s executive actions on immigration—and if congress refuses to act, do everything possible to go further.
republicans just voted to repeal obamacare and defund planned parenthood. good thing we have a democratic president:
our next president needs to do everything possible to make life a little easier for working parents.
not being able to vote yet isn’t stopping 17-year-old patrick from doing everything he can to elect hillary.

donald trump is not who we are.

when it comes to protecting and building on president obama’s progress, there’s only one candidate who will get it done.
president obama’s successor cannot and will not be the man who led the racist birther movement. period.
we cannot let donald trump become the next president.
we cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in donald trump’s hands. we cannot let him roll the dice with america.
we cannot afford to have a republican succeed barack obama as president of the united states.
we cannot let trump or any of the republican candidates win the white house. add your name if you agree:

one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
what trump really means when he says "make america great again”:
the next president—and her husband.
in 1991 hillary clinton filed her husband's papers to run for president. in 2015 she filed her own.
before iowa, i was in nc with my husband aaron & our cat pretzel. when hillary announced i knew i had to be here.
hillary in new hampshire:
thank you, virginia and senator @timkaine .
what would it mean to have a former secretary of state in the white house? this.
here's what we can't afford: a republican in the white house.
here's what you can do to make sure @realdonaldtrump never reaches the white house:
"voters can count on her to bring that same passion for getting the job done to the white house."

that's all for me! thanks for the opportunity, hillary—& thank you for fighting for women & business owners like me!
donald trump said he has "great respect" for women. his actions and words say otherwise.
three answers from last night’s @msnbc town hall that you should see:
let's dispel with this fiction that @potus doesn't know what he's doing. he knows exactly what he's doing.
he’s always doing that.
pres. obama doesn't get the credit he deserves for the job he's done...i want to build on that progress—but i want to go further. 
nobody here was “having fun” except for trump.
trump isn’t just incoherent; he’s dangerous. he’s not just unprepared; he’s temperamentally unfit to be commander-in-chief.
. @johnkasich is right on one thing: the budget was balanced under president bill clinton.
“i will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for you and for your families across our country.”
it's time to choose once and for all: will we stand with the nra, or stand up to it?
as president hillary will stand up for kids and families. she’s done it her whole life:
one candidate would stand up for workers and their families. the other? not so much.
it’s time to pick a side: stand with the gun lobby or stand up to it.
we have new challenges; we need new solutions.
now we know what trump really thinks about us. sad!
nobody's going to be left in this country that he's exempted from insults.  on trump in california:
donald trump has spent years peddling lies about president obama. and that didn't stop today.
i’m running for president to make our economy work for you and for every american. it's your time. let's do this together.

i support this deal—as part of a larger strategy toward iran. 
“an open seat at the state of the union will honor gun violence victims—including my 6-year-old.”
what would a state of the union be like under a republican president? here’s a disturbing preview.
does trump think he can fool us into forgetting his hateful rhetoric? sad!
no bank is too big to fail. no executive is too big to jail. 
there is something wrong with our country. there is too much violence...too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn’t be.

trump says he'd be "the best for women." anyone who'd defund @ppfa and wipe out safe, legal abortion has no idea what’s best for women.
here are 35 questions trump still needs to answer.
it’s never too early to start asking the tough questions. in case you missed it:
"i ask you to do for hillary clinton what you did for me. i ask you to carry her the same way you carried me.”

i’m running for president to make our economy work for you and for every american. it's your time. let's do this together.

what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
there's no excuse for racism and violence on a college campus.  
it is not enough to contain isis—we must defeat isis. break its momentum, and then its back. 
"i know what it's like to go into the primaries up. and i know what it's like to come out of them down."
it’s not just that trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to national security. his words are dangerous, and they hurt us.
if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
when it comes to terrorism, we know what doesn’t work (bluster and bigotry) and what does (steady leadership).

what donald trump did in atlantic city is nothing to brag about—it’s shameful—and every voter in america needs to know about it.
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.

we should build a path to citizenship, not a wall on the border.
"if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. and when you get ahead, america gets ahead."
trump's wall on the border would likely cost at least $25 billion. some things we could do instead:
if you already have student debt, we’ll help you refinance and pay it back as a percentage of your income.
he’s always doing that.
when you have a really, really good night.
economists project that trump’s plans would add more than $5,000,000,000,000 to the national debt. that's "trillion" with a "t."

i'm told the number just ticked over: as of a few minutes ago, 1,000,000 people have pitched in to be a part of this campaign. thank you. 
we have more to do for equality. we're going to fight for lgbt rights, women's rights, voting rights, workers' rights—and more.

"the measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hard-working families—not just for successful ceos and money managers."

every american stands in strong solidarity with the people of france  on the attack in nice
every day, donald trump proves that he’s not in this for the american people. he’s in it for himself. 
how do you know hillary will fight for equal pay? she's been doing it for years. learn about her record and ideas:
"she has so much compassion and it shows. she's a person, she's a grandmother, she's somebody's mother."
i’ve been called a lot of things over the years, but ‘unqualified’ has not been one of them. 
hillary's been fighting for women and girls her entire career—and she's just getting started.
at the  , we agree we need universal health care. that’s why hillary’s been fighting for it for 20+ years.

which gop candidate would you want to see hillary take on in a debate? cast your vote!
if anyone needed a reminder of how important it is to take back the senate & hold onto the white house—look at the supreme court. 
donald trump's business strategy: it's not about what you can build. it's about how much you can take.

north korea’s decision to conduct another nuclear test is outrageous and unacceptable.

hillary's supporters have supporters of their own. here's some of the best fatherly advice you've passed along.
bernie sanders and i will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all. 
donald trump's tax plan would add $30 trillion to the national debt over 20 years. that's "trillion"—with a "t."
today's attack in baghdad is another horrific example of isis's savagery. we will defeat them. my prayers are with the victims' families.

hillary’s answer shows *exactly* what it would mean to have a former secretary of state in the oval office.
here’s why having a former secretary of state in the oval office would be a smart move:

we need a fighter for children and families in the white house.
rt if you're standing with her all the way to the white house.
here's what we can't afford: a republican in the white house.
our economy is always stronger with a democrat in the white house.
with every republican attacking safe and legal abortion, women need more than an ally in the white house: we need a fighter.
we believe that everyone has value. we believe that everyone's created equal. we believe that love trumps hate.
if the space you’re in doesn’t have room for your voice don’t be afraid to carve out a space of your own. 
the trump marina hotel casino in atlantic city was sold just a few years ago at a huge loss.

an idea you won't hear at the  : if you work hard, you should be able to succeed—no matter who you are or where you come from.
thank you, @potus .
when you work hard, you should not be living in poverty.
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
"because of you, this campaign is the only one—democrat or republican—to win 10 million votes.”
this isn't who we are, and it also isn't how we keep america safe.
what the world needs now is love.
don’t let anyone tell you that america isn’t great. donald trump’s got america all wrong.
as a smart man once said, there’s nothing wrong with america that can’t be fixed by what is right with america. 
we need to build on what makes america great–our energy and optimism, our openness and creativity.
fixing our immigration system will strengthen families, our economy, and our country.
our veterans and military families deserve better.
it’s time to reclaim our democracy. we need to overturn citizens united, fix our campaign finance system, and protect voting rights.
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump

it’s a simple but powerful idea. we are fairer together. we are better together. we are stronger together.
let's build this together.
let's go win this, together.
"we truly are stronger together — and together, we’re going to make history." a note from hillary:
we have to stand together and be proud together. there is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate.
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
donald trump says he wants to make america great again—well, he could start by actually making things in america again. 
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
america needs leadership in the white house, not a liability.

politics are hard. but when it comes to gun violence, we cannot give up. we cannot sit by while more good people die. we must keep going.

new york is home to 20 million people. we don’t all look the same. we don’t all sound the same or worship the same, but we pull together.
we cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in donald trump’s hands. we cannot let him roll the dice with america.
if you cheat your employees, exploit your customers, pollute our environment, or rip off taxpayers, we will hold you accountable. 
to those running our country's corporations: if you cheat employees, exploit consumers, or rip off taxpayers, we’re going to make you pay.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
donald trump's business strategy: it's not about what you can build. it's about how much you can take.
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.
big win for those who think we should make it easier, not harder, to vote (which really should be all of us).  
no company in america should be able to pay women less for the work they do.
the buffett rule says millionaires should pay more of what they can afford in taxes. hillary will make sure they do.

if you stand for equal rights, if you stand against discrimination, you don't just do it once—you've got to keep fighting. 
you can’t just talk someone into trusting you. you’ve got to earn it ... i believe what you say matters. 
if you see bigotry, you should oppose it. if you see violence, you should condemn it. if you see a bully, you should stand up to him.
the reports from paris are harrowing. praying for the city and families of the victims. 
today's attack in baghdad is another horrific example of isis's savagery. we will defeat them. my prayers are with the victims' families. 
my prayers are with the victims of the horrific easter day attack in lahore. pakistan and all nations must confront & defeat terrorists.

no one is too big to jail–even on wall street.
four years as secretary of state—she's got a bit of experience on foreign policy.
a reminder of what a presidential candidate with real foreign policy experience looks like   6/status/676961083794542592 …
we are going to stop wall street hurting main street.  at the
what needs to change on wall street, according to the “economikes.”
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
our next president has to bring our country together. we should be breaking down barriers, not building walls.
hillary stands up for planned parenthood—and women's rights.
our elections should be shaped by voters' voices—not bought and sold by corporations & special interests :
we need leaders...who put the interests of the american people ahead of their personal business interests.  at
chip in now, and you can always say you were one of the very first donors of the  campaign:
tonight's only possible because millions of organizers, volunteers, and donors fought for this campaign. thank you.
hillary is proud to  . rt if you are too.
chelsea, thank you. i am so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you’ve become. 
if fighting for policies that help families get ahead is playing the  —well then, proud to play it.
proud to stand for quality, affordable health care. proud to  .
"some days" we're pretty proud of.
“what i’ve laid out is a path forward that will keep us safer...and go after the terrorists to finally destroy them"
we should build a path to citizenship, not a wall on the border.
in america, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you.
we can’t go back to the old policies that failed us before.
"we can’t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship."
we have a sacred responsibility to those who serve and sacrifice for this country—today we remember and honor the values they fought for. 
our fallen heroes deserve our profound gratitude for giving their lives to protect our freedom, today and every day.  
workers are our economy's greatest strength—not costs to be cut. they shouldn't sacrifice while executives skate by.
the american people have always made this country great.
we "can’t sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need. we must choose resolve—and we must lead the world to meet this threat."
i want to thank bernie sanders. bernie, your campaign inspired millions of americans. 
bernie sanders and i will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all. 
“it's time for us to say, we're better than this." hillary's plan to prevent gun violence:
it’s time for us to say, wait a minute. we’re better than this. our country is better than this.  on gun violence
i’m running for president to make our economy work for you and for every american. it's your time. let's do this together. 
what trump really means when he says "make america great again”:
america must lead the world in developing and deploying new clean energy sources that will power our economy.
"you have made me a better person and helped me believe i can do anything."
presidents have to be ready to tackle any issue that comes to their desk.
these little girls have a message for america: when it comes to presidents, “44 boys is too many.”  8-4f55-b9dc-cafd2f32a2fa …
no one gets through life alone. we have to look out for each other and lift each other up. 
we need to start listening to each other. hearing each other. walking in each other’s shoes.
lincoln: "war, at its best, is terrible." trump: "i love war." how trump's words compare to former presidents':
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
you don’t make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great.  on donald trump
“as president, she won’t just say she’s going to do something. she will follow through and actually do it.”
"she has so much compassion and it shows. she's a person, she's a grandmother, she's somebody's mother."
“we worked with hillary clinton. here’s how we know she’s committed to fighting climate change.”
we have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world. we have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had. 
young americans have the most to gain from hillary's economic plan—and the most to lose under trump's policies.
i’m proud of the experience and judgment i would bring to this job. a president has to be able to do all parts of the job. 
it's easy to say you'll fix wall street—it's harder to actually do it. hillary has a plan to get it done.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
we need a president who can do all aspects of the job...i'm ready to take it on. 
americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.
the president has to strengthen the economy, fight for families, and keep the country safe. that's the job.

you shouldn't have to worry about your paycheck or your job when you have a baby or someone in your family gets sick.
“as president, she won’t just say she’s going to do something. she will follow through and actually do it.”
"she has so much compassion and it shows. she's a person, she's a grandmother, she's somebody's mother."
"she cares. she tries. she perseveres." @jonfavs on supporting hillary in 2016:
we know hillary’s a fighter & that she’ll fight for adam as president just like she did at the children’s defense fund & in congress.
an idea you won't hear at the  : if you work hard, you should be able to succeed—no matter who you are or where you come from.
"because of you, this campaign is the only one—democrat or republican—to win 10 million votes.”
we’ve earned more votes than any other candidate—republican or democrat.
it’s not whether you get knocked down that matters, it’s whether you get back up.  in nh
it’s not whether you get knocked down that matters, it’s whether you get back up.  4-4e7a-a936-8fecfbfa27d0 …

americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.
we need a president who can take on republicans and get the job done.
democrats all agree that affordable health care should be a right. we need a real plan to get it done.
america has always been about working together to get things done.
it's easy to say you'll fix wall street—it's harder to actually do it. hillary has a plan to get it done.
it’s not the big banks that need relief from washington—it’s small banks and small businesses.
we already have dodd-frank. we need to go further to tackle dangerous risks in the big banks—and outside the big banks.
prison is not a substitute for treatment for drug addiction and mental health issues.

donald trump says he wants to "make america great again." well, he could start by actually making things in america.
donald trump says he wants to make america great again—well, he could start by actually making things in america again. 
every child in america deserves clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and a safe and healthy place to live.
"investing in clean energy will: create millions of jobs let us lead the global fight against climate change"
every child and every family in america deserves clean air to breathe, clean water to drink and a safe and healthy place to live. 
clean air shouldn't be a luxury in america.
we can take on the threat of climate change and make america a clean energy superpower. or, we can do nothing.

we know donald trump is not who we are. if you want to shut him down, then let’s vote him down.
" @wired sees only one person running for president who can do the job: hillary clinton."
donald trump is not who we are.
donald trump is proud of his recklessness—that’s his business. but when he’s running for president, it’s ours.

hillary on her vision for the country:
donald trump called her "miss piggy" and "miss housekeeping." her name is alicia machado.
the lesson of our history, through good times and hard times, is that we’re stronger together. 
there is something wrong with our country. there is too much violence...too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn’t be.
go vote, new york. it'll only take you one try.
what’s happening in flint is unconscionable—and there are too many other flints out there.  
there's too much at stake to let republicans take us backwards.
big (and small) support for hillary in new hampshire.
we asked new yorkers what they really think of donald trump. they didn’t hold back.
had so much fun at @theellenshow today. tune in on thursday!
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.

i don’t think that any family should have to pay more than 10% of their income on child care. 
"the second fight is to strengthen america's families, because when our families are strong, america is strong."
when any barrier falls in america, it clears the way for everyone.
"you know, before it was called obamacare, it was called hillarycare."
"i’ve been called many things by many people. 'quitter' is not one of them."
"that's called business." —donald trump on the housing crash. for millions of americans it was called "losing their home."

i've never heard an american leader...claiming that he's all we need. that's not a democracy, my friends. 
the safety of our kids is more important than the interests of the nra. our leaders should act like it.
marriage equality is the law of the land. deal with it.
donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. 
“even if people don’t vote for me in november, i’m going to be for them and for you every single day.”
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
we've focused on issues. we share a lot of the same progressive goals; we have different ways of going about them. 
12. how can we be sure you'd be willing to be tough on any nation if necessary, if it would put your interests and profits at risk?
the house voting to defund planned parenthood is an attack on women's health—nothing more, nothing less. republicans should be ashamed.
if we stand together, there's nothing we can't do. make sure you're ready to vote:
my opponent has america all wrong. there’s nothing we can’t do when we come together as one nation. 
we are resilient, determined, and hard-working. there’s nothing america can’t do if we do it together.
as a smart man once said, there’s nothing wrong with america that can’t be fixed by what is right with america. 
if you think hillary is the best person to be president, chip in $1:
no one can get this done alone—not even the president of the united states. it’s got to be the mission of our entire nation.
we need a president who understands that none of us has all the answers and no one person can fix our problems alone.
our next president needs to have the right temperament to meet the challenges we face.

the more time that passes, the scarier this gets.
if mr. trump gets his way, it'll be like christmas in the kremlin. it will make america less safe and the world more dangerous. 
you can learn a lot about a person by the company they keep. here's some of the company trump keeps:
i’m proud of the experience and judgment i would bring to this job. a president has to be able to do all parts of the job. 
we need a president who sees the best in all of us.
you should never have to choose between your family & your paycheck. proud of all we accomplished with  —next, paid leave for all. 
as we methodists like to say: do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can. 
do all the good we can, in all the ways we can, in all the places we can, for all the people we can.  2-48ed-85c7-3f1e5b81efc4 …
i will bring law enforcement and communities together to develop national guidelines on the use of force by police officers. 
we need strategies to fight crime & restore trust between law enforcement and our communities, especially communities of color.
end mass incarceration. address inequality. restore trust between law enforcement & communities. read this & share:
we cannot, must not, vilify police officers. remember what those officers were doing when they died. they were protecting a peaceful march.
taking on systemic racism and rebuilding trust and respect between law enforcement and the communities they serve will require all of us.
@billclinton it's a date!
"i never said that." —donald trump, who said that.   p/status/265895292191248385 …
donald trump told lie after lie last night because it's all he has to offer the american people.
we can take on the threat of climate change and make america a clean energy superpower. or, we can do nothing.
we can’t cozy up to dictators; we have to stand up to them. we can’t contain isis; we must defeat it. and we will.
let's stand together to do all the good we can, in all the ways we can, for as long as we can.  7-4404-9642-150933e80e35 …

reason  the nra has never helped hillary get elected.
the choice: hillary is standing up to the nra. senator sanders voted with them.
it's time to choose once and for all: will we stand with the nra, or stand up to it?

"it's about time this country had somebody running it who has an idea about money." —trump
he’s always doing that.
"when all americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our country’s prosperity—that’s fair growth."
when you work hard, you should not be living in poverty.
your hard work should be reflected in a rising paycheck.
the great recession hit our whole country hard, but the toll was especially hard on black and latino families.
say you’re on team  :
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.

one candidate made it clear he wasn’t prepared for last night’s debate. the other made it clear she’s prepared to be president.
only one person on last night's stage is prepared to be commander-in-chief. make sure she gets the chance:
trump: "i love war, in a certain way."
here's an easy way to help hillary win in new hampshire—it only takes 5 minutes!
hillary's statement on the trans-pacific partnership:
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
we need to come together to turn the tide, stop violence, build trust, and give all our kids the chance to grow up safe and healthy.
america never stopped being great. we just need to make it work for everyone.
“we endorsed her because she endorsed us.”
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
it’s time for more businesses to start treating workers as assets to be invested in, not costs to be cut.

if you could tell hillary why you're on her team, what would you say?
if you agree hillary is the president we need, tell us why you're standing with her:
i don’t know about you, but we’re fired up and ready to go! 
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
if you see bigotry, you should oppose it. if you see violence, you should condemn it. if you see a bully, you should stand up to him.
there is no other donald trump. this is it.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
you don't say, mike.
rt if you agree with hillary.
if you agree with hillary, add your name to let her know:
you know hillary's a candidate—but did you know she's also a  winner? more things you never knew about her:
we can't allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values—that's not who we are as americans. we're better than that.
do all the good we can, in all the ways we can, in all the places we can, for all the people we can.  2-48ed-85c7-3f1e5b81efc4 …
people can’t board planes with full shampoo bottles—but people being watched by the fbi for terrorism can buy a gun, no questions asked?
we should insist that ending gun violence is a priority in this election.
trump's extreme immigration speech got rave reviews—from white supremacists, the alt-right, and ann coulter.
hillary on the faith that drives her: "do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can."

"i'm most concerned about the kids who are left out and left behind."
donald trump is more concerned with pandering to the gun lobby than keeping families safe.
let’s go out and build the future.
we are  to ensure that transgender people are treated with the equal rights and dignity they deserve.

hillary for america. let’s go.

business can be a powerful force of change—there’s something significant in the community work we do. i'm proud to create jobs & give back.

mary jo, you're right: business can be a powerful force for change, & yours certainly is. thanks for inviting us in, one tweet at a time. 
donald trump isn't on stage at the  —but you can bet the same backwards ideas and out-of-touch rhetoric will be out in force.
the force is strong with this one.
seven years of progress. we need to build on it—not go backwards.
hillary in new york yesterday:
three days to new hampshire.
there’s only one candidate who will defend and build on the progress we've made.
the aca is one of the greatest accomplishments of president obama, the democratic party, and america. we shouldn't go backwards.
trump's statements are lies—but he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.
president obama’s job was to save us from a second great depression—and that’s exactly what he did. 
president obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done. 
trump's rhetoric is shameful. it was one thing when he was a reality tv personality. it’s another when he’s running for president.
he’s always doing that.
donald trump’s not just wrong about judge curiele’s wrong about america. he’s wrong about what makes this country great.

fdr came up with the perfect rebuke to donald trump more than 80 years ago: “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”
there are more mass shootings in the united states than any other country in the world...we cannot accept this. not now—not ever. 
trump is right about one thing.
we’ve earned more votes than any other candidate—republican or democrat.
we cannot keep imprisoning more people than anyone else in the world.
are you with hillary? let her know:
there is something wrong with our country. there is too much violence...too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn’t be.
donald trump actually stood on a debate stage in november and said that wages are too high in this country. 
here’s what people were texting hillary while she was on the debate stage.
next week, hillary will walk on stage for the first presidential debate. chip in now for the chance to be there:
trump is right about one thing.
q: "saying [a judge] can't do his job because of his race—is that not the definition of racism?" trump: "no."
race still plays a role in who gets ahead and who gets held back. hillary will fight to change that. join her:

if you were president, how would you spend $4 billion? (one guess as to trump's answer:  )
this country belongs to all of us—not just to those at the top. not just to people who look one way, worship one way, or even think one way.

hillary is the only candidate on stage who has pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class.

we're not at war with a religion; we're at war with radical jihadism. muslim americans: this is your country too.

waiting in line to vote? stay put’s counting on you! rt to tell a friend.
"i know more about isis than the generals do." —donald trump no, you don't.
a vote in 2002 is not a strategy to defeat isis now.
trump says he “knows more about isis than the generals do.” not only is that wrong, it's disrespectful to our men and women in uniform.
at last night's forum, trump disrespected our generals, our country, and women in the military—but he praised putin.
no child should ever have to grow up in poverty, yet far too many do. we have to do better. here's how:

trump says he hires the best people. this is what he means:
. @realdonaldtrump says he’ll be “the best for women.” don't think so.
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.

it’s not just that trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to national security. his words are dangerous, and they hurt us.
unions stand up for workers who need someone to have their backs. we need a president who will do the same.
these things can be true at once: we need criminal justice reform. we need to support police. we need to do more to stop gun violence.
we need ideas, not insults. plans, not paranoia. we can’t let @potus 's legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn’t understand that.
president trump? cruz? rubio? carson?
i will bring law enforcement and communities together to develop national guidelines on the use of force by police officers. 
we cannot, must not, vilify police officers. remember what those officers were doing when they died. they were protecting a peaceful march.

we are going to stop wall street hurting main street.  at the

no one is too big to jail–even on wall street.
we need to make sure there’s accountability on wall street so there can be prosperity on main street.
we need to say loudly and clearly: we will not let wall street wreck main street again.
it’s not just that trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to national security. his words are dangerous, and they hurt us.
in times like these, we need a president who can help pull us together, not split us apart. and that's why donald trump is so dangerous.
we need more love and kindness in this country...the last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are. 
if you are too dangerous to fly in america, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in america. 
donald trump is not who we are.
"together we’re going to build an america where...a father can tell his daughter, 'you can be anything you want to be—including president.'"

how will hillary address the substance abuse epidemic? join @mayaharris_ and @sarasolow for a q&a today at 12:30 et:
it is legal to pay workers with disabilities less than the minimum wage. let's end that:
$7.25 an hour is a starvation wage. so sorry donald, if you’re watching, we’re not cutting the minimum wage, we’re raising the minimum wage.
if trump had his way, the federal minimum wage would be $0.
raising the minimum wage will help millions of families around the country—especially women:
anybody working full-time should not be living in poverty. it’s time to raise the minimum wage.
"we have a presidential candidate by the name of donald trump saying that women should be punished."
for the first time in our history, a woman will be a major party’s nominee for president of the united states.

statement on the passing of supreme court justice antonin scalia:
we’ll remember the pain of the mothers of the movement and fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice. 
our next president could have the power to transform the supreme court for generations.
we can’t let donald trump anywhere near the supreme court.
. @potus is doing his job by nominating a new supreme court justice. tell senate republicans to do theirs:
"she has so much compassion and it shows. she's a person, she's a grandmother, she's somebody's mother."
“as president, she won’t just say she’s going to do something. she will follow through and actually do it.”
"she cares. she tries. she perseveres." @jonfavs on supporting hillary in 2016:
“she gained about 55 pounds in...9 months. she was like an eating machine.” —trump, a man who wants to be president:
. @realdonaldtrump : “i’m the last person she wants to run against."
we can build on a strong progressive tradition from franklin roosevelt to barack obama. 
hillary on facing years of politically motivated attacks: "i’m still standing and i will be standing."
makes it clear. there's only one thing standing between republicans & repeal of the affordable care act: a democratic president.
as of tonight, only one thing is standing between donald trump and the presidency: all of us. get your free sticker:
"all of these reforms...are commonsense ways to strengthen our democracy, but none of them will come easily. it’s going to take leadership."

anybody who thinks that they can influence what i will do doesn't know me very well. 
"we need a supreme court who cares more about the right to vote of a person than the right to buy an election of a corporation."
a man who talks about our veterans and military families like this doesn't deserve to be commander-in-chief.
"she has so much compassion and it shows. she's a person, she's a grandmother, she's somebody's mother."
“as president, she won’t just say she’s going to do something. she will follow through and actually do it.”

how do we get more in the workforce? paid leave, equal pay, child care—won't hear that from republicans.

donald trump is not who we are.
50 gop national security experts said they will not vote for trump because he would be “the most reckless president in american history.”
every day, donald trump proves that he’s not in this for the american people. he’s in it for himself. 
he sure doesn’t speak for me, because i know we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re going to be.  on trump
unlike donald trump, i will not pander to the gun lobby. we will not be silenced and we will not be intimidated. 
"workers are assets. investing in them pays off. higher wages pay off. and training pays off."
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
you don’t make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great in the first place.
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
donald trump says he wants to make america great again—well, he could start by actually making things in america again.

“atlantic city was a very good cash cow for me for a long time...the money i took out of there was incredible.” —donald trump
the trump marina hotel casino in atlantic city was sold just a few years ago at a huge loss.
some of the (many, many) reasons donald trump isn't fit to be commander-in-chief.
what donald trump did in atlantic city is nothing to brag about—it’s shameful—and every voter in america needs to know about it.
as your president, i will always have your back. 
the 400 richest taxpayers in america would get an average tax cut of more than $15 million a year from the trump loophole.

if you want to know what someone’s really like, ask his neighbors when he's not around.
people who are working hard should get the respect, dignity, and income they deserve. middle-class families need a raise.
we have the most productive workers in the world. we just need to give our people a chance to succeed:
you can go to  to make sure you are registered. and i hope you all will. 
we have the most productive and competitive workers in the world. we just need to give them a chance to succeed.
you can't fight what you don't believe exists. climate change is real and we must meet this challenge.  
what trump just did is a disgrace.
so, how did donald trump's first swing at diplomacy go? not so great. try to follow his decision-making process:
the voting rights act turns 50 this week. when did you cast your first ballot & what did it mean to you? share your story with  .
"i ask you to do for hillary clinton what you did for me. i ask you to carry her the same way you carried me.”
if the young women of this country have donald trump as their president, what will they think of themselves?
these candidates don't seem to mind a "big government" when it's politicians interfering in women's personal health decisions.

"together we’re going to build an america where...a father can tell his daughter, 'you can be anything you want to be—including president.'"
if we aren't doing everything we can to prevent  , then we're not doing nearly enough.
when you have a really, really good night.
"if you would like help with your campaign, i am available and i would work for candy."
six years in, the aca has brought us closer than ever to making sure every american has access to health care.

getting ready to make some history.
today’s the day! ready to stand with hillary? say  now:

fired up, ready to go!
ready to pass the baton.
hillary's prescription plan would cap out-of-pocket costs at $250 per month. what would you do with your savings?
imagine if this was our president.
hillary has a plan to cap covered prescription drug costs at $250 per month:
while families are struggling to pay for child care, donald trump actually argued that americans are being paid too much.
that's all for me! thanks for the opportunity, hillary—& thank you for fighting for women & business owners like me!
hillary on @pontifex 's climate message: "there’s no time to waste. we have to act now. pope francis is right."
this is what it would be like for a former secretary of state to be president:
"if you would like help with your campaign, i am available and i would work for candy."
remember: if he becomes president, donald trump would have the . economy in his hands.
what would our country look like under a republican president? here’s a glimpse.

if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
i will keep doing what i’ve done my entire life. i will keep standing up for you. i will keep fighting for you. 
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
republicans have it wrong on many issues facing americans this election. tell us: what are you fighting for?
in this debate, we tried to deal with the very tough issues facing our country—in stark contrast to the republicans. 
hillary's getting ready to lay out her plan to make sure every american can vote. why is this important to you?
this shouldn't have to be said: you don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. it doesn’t work. no one buys it.

the trump marina hotel casino in atlantic city was sold just a few years ago at a huge loss.
what donald trump did in atlantic city is nothing to brag about—it’s shameful—and every voter in america needs to know about it.
“atlantic city was a very good cash cow for me for a long time...the money i took out of there was incredible.” —donald trump
"you have made me a better person and helped me believe i can do anything."
for forty years, every presidential candidate has released their tax returns—except for trump. what's he hiding?
so what exactly is donald trump hiding from voters? pretty much everything.
presidents have to be ready to tackle any issue that comes to their desk.
no wonder donald trump is hiding his tax returns.
happy birthday, @potus .
happy birthday, @katyperry !
cheers to you, @jimmyfallon . happy birthday!
i accept your nomination for president of the united states! 
happy birthday, malala! thank you for fighting for every girl's right to an education.

if you want a president who will listen to you, work her heart out to make your life better—then you’re lookin’ at her.
people are angry. and they have every right to be. but i know they’re also hungry. they’re hungry for solutions. 
trump is right about one thing.
"her way of dealing with the stories she hears is not just to repeat the story but to do something about the story."
“you’ve always had my back, and i’ve always tried to have yours.”
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
if you could tell hillary why you're on her team, what would you say?
“i have this old-fashioned notion that if you’re running for president, you should say what you’re going to do.”
when you run for president of the united states, the entire world is watching.  on @realdonaldtrump 's dangerous rhetoric
if you like donald trump, you’re going to love his choice for vice president.
"trump just criticized me for preparing for this debate. you know what else i prepared for? being president."
flint wasn't just treated with indifference, it was treated with neglect, and that isn't acceptable.

"when all americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our country’s prosperity—that’s fair growth."

we need leaders...who put the interests of the american people ahead of their personal business interests.  at
"americorps is a...cost-effective solution to some of our nation’s most pressing issues." hillary wants to expand it:
there’s no place for second-class status in the united states of america.
the united states is the only country in the developed world without guaranteed paid leave. that has to change.
"the united states needs to lead in the americas. and if we don't, make no mistake—others will."
the united states is the only country in the developed world without guaranteed paid leave. this needs to change.
donald trump still refuses to admit president obama was born in the united states.

donald trump says, and this is a quote, 'i know more about isis than the generals do.' no, donald, you don't. 
we can’t afford another major ground war in the middle east—that's exactly what isis wants.
our goal must not be to deter or contain isis. our goal must be to defeat isis.
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump.

with the money trump would waste on his wall, we could help a lot of families by building infrastructure we need.

hard to believe they spent so much time talking about me and no time talking about jobs or education or health care.  on the rnc
what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
let's dispel with this fiction that @potus doesn't know what he's doing. he knows exactly what he's doing.
our roads, bridges, and airports are in a sorry state. hillary will invest in the infrastructure america deserves:  1-43cd-912a-29bed0d92cac …
only one candidate in this election knows how to build coalitions and make the world safer—because she's done it.
how much do you know about the loopholes in our gun laws?
families pay over $500 per year on car maintenance because of deteriorating roads. we need to invest in our infrastructure.

any candidate seriously competing to be president should seriously campaign everywhere. that’s what we’ve done.
when we talk about the outrage happening in flint, it's important to talk about who lives there.
when we talk about criminal justice reform, we also have to talk about jobs, education, and housing.
nevada: if you're in line, stay there—and talk to your neighbors about hillary!
when we talk about the flint water crisis, we also have to talk about its root causes—economic, racial, and other.
there is something wrong with our country. there is too much violence...too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn’t be.
it’s not the big banks that need relief from washington—it’s small banks and small businesses.
when small businesses are strong, our economy is strong.
helping small businesses succeed is about more than policy—it's personal.
we need to do more to support small businesses—particularly minority- and women-owned businesses—so they can get financing and grow.
reauthorizing @eximbankus means supporting america's small businesses. time for congress to put politics aside & act.

the threat that donald trump poses is so dramatic to our country, to our democracy.  on @cnn

it’s time to pick a side: stand with the gun lobby or stand up to it.
trump’s hateful comments aren’t just an affront to our values—they’re a threat to our national security.

however you serve, it feels great to be a part of something bigger than yourself—to work toward making something good happen in the world.
what is hillary's greatest accomplishment? here's a list from 20 top american leaders and strategists:
some of america's most powerful women tell us why they support hillary:
we don't live in a single-issue country. we need to tackle all the barriers holding americans back.
i want to break down all the barriers holding americans back...but [our] problems can’t be reduced to wall street and washington. 
women still make less than men, with women of color facing an even bigger gap. this isn't just holding women back—it's holding america back.
"the last thing we need...is a president who doesn’t care about whether millions will lose access to health care coverage." —bernie on trump

students should never have to take out a loan to pay for tuition at their state’s public university.
no american should have to take out a loan to pay tuition at a public college. we should also help people with existing student debt.

hillary on her vision for the country:
hillary told her story and shared her vision for the future—now, add your notes using @genius :
kareem abdul-jabbar on hillary: she can envision a better world and take the steps to make that vision a reality.
my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for america.
the  is offering a stark picture of one vision for america. here's another:
harriet tubman could be the first woman on the $20 bill. awesome, well deserved—and about time.
well done, ireland. 
well said, @jimmyfallon .
a day to remember.
she told me that he was a great runner! i just thought, "how would this happen?" i knew it should happen, but i also knew the challenges.
he’s always doing that.
let's dispel with this fiction that @potus doesn't know what he's doing. he knows exactly what he's doing.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
if you could tell hillary why you're on her team, what would you say?
don’t let anyone tell you that our country is weak—we’re not. don’t let anyone tell you we don’t have what it takes—we do.
there’s an old mexican proverb that says “tell me with whom you walk, and i will tell you who you are.” we know who trump is.

you don’t make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great in the first place.
one of these people could decide the future of your rights.
yes, @realdonaldtrump really did say all of these hateful things.
the "winners" from last night's  :
trump hired the head of breitbart "news" to be ceo of his campaign. here's a sample of their work:
"both my workers and i were better off." why this ceo thinks profit-sharing = higher incomes + more productivity:
a 10% flat tax? a ceo should never be paying the same rate as a kindergarten teacher.
this election is a choice between an economy that benefits everyone or an economy that benefits...donald trump.
the choice on jobs in this election (it’s not a hard one).
we must fight for criminal justice reform. everyone is safer when there is respect for the law and when everyone is respected by the law.
trump is fanning the flames of chaos and violence. that's not leadership—it’s dangerous.
america needs a president who can both keep our families safe and make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.
in america, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you.

trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
donald trump doesn't seem to actually care about making america great so much as he seems to care about making himself look great.
"[changes in our economy] don’t determine our destiny. the choices we make as a nation matter."

one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:

this 19-year-old voter in new hampshire was on the fence until he heard @billclinton speak on hillary's experience.
a vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat isis in 2016.

we don’t want to turn against each other. we want to work with one another. we want to set big goals in this country.
pres. obama doesn't get the credit he deserves for the job he's done...i want to build on that progress—but i want to go further. 
americans are hungry for solutions. they don’t just want us to diagnose problems, they want us to solve them.
i don't want to see us start over again. i want us to defend and build on the affordable care act and improve it. 
i want to get comprehensive immigration reform. and i want to start trying to get it as soon as i'm elected, if i'm so fortunate. 
want to do more to support  ? you're in luck:

we know donald trump is not who we are. if you want to shut him down, then let’s vote him down.
republicans just voted to repeal obamacare and defund planned parenthood. good thing we have a democratic president:
the same people [trump's] trying to get to vote for him now are people he’s been exploiting for years :
we are better than this.
we cannot keep imprisoning more people than anyone else in the world.
so much to be thankful for. wishing a happy thanksgiving to you and yours. 
our veterans have done so much for us; now we need to do more for them. read hillary’s op-ed in the @militarytimes :

the reports from paris are harrowing. praying for the city and families of the victims. 
"i join americans in praying for the victims of the attack in orlando." hillary's statement:
today's attack in baghdad is another horrific example of isis's savagery. we will defeat them. my prayers are with the victims' families.

you’re the reason we’re going to win this nomination and then win this election together.
"i have this old fashioned idea that we elect a president to keep us safe...i’m not going to let the gun lobby tell me that’s not right."
donald trump's business strategy: it's not about what you can build. it's about how much you can take.
a vote in 2002 is not a strategy to defeat isis now.
we need to recognize that quality, affordable childcare is not a luxury–it's a growth strategy.

one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
“we endorsed her because she endorsed us.”
it matters what we do, not just what we say. it didn’t matter what we called bin laden—it mattered that we got bin laden. 
president obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done. 
pres. obama doesn't get the credit he deserves for the job he's done...i want to build on that progress—but i want to go further. 
no, barack obama is not the founder of isis.
when our seals took out bin laden, they brought the terrorists' families to safety first. that's american honor.

we are better than this.
donald trump says that wages are too high, but we know better. americans deserve a raise.
no child should ever have to grow up in poverty, yet far too many do. we have to do better. here's how:
anybody working full-time should not be living in poverty. it’s time to raise the minimum wage.
it’s time for donald trump to be held to the same standard of disclosure as any other major party nominee.
"we should set a standard across our country of at least 20 days of early in-person voting everywhere."
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
you can’t just talk someone into trusting you. you’ve got to earn it ... i believe what you say matters.

dr. king's fight for equality in education, in economic opportunity, and in our criminal justice system is still our fight today. 
today marks the 167th anniversary of the seneca falls convention—a milestone for women's equality.
48 years ago, we lost a giant in the fight for equality. let’s honor dr. king and keep bending the arc of the moral universe toward justice.
this  , we honor those who sacrificed for equality & fought for justice, and we recognize those who carry on the legacy. 
i believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.

trump's rhetoric is shameful. it was one thing when he was a reality tv personality. it’s another when he’s running for president.
donald trump still refuses to say @potus was born in america. and this man wants to be our president? when will he stop this ugliness?

medicare and medicaid stories: celebrating 50 years of lives saved.
trump "doesn’t have a clue about the middle class… “he has no clue about what makes america great. actually, he has no clue—period." —biden
medicare and medicaid have saved lives for half a century. an attack on them is an attack on seniors and vulnerable americans. 
america has always been a country of "we," not "me." and we've always been stronger together.
we are a nation of second chances, especially for young people. good news from scotus today.

we need a president who can take on republicans and get the job done.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
president obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done. 
americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.

if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
trump's candidacy is built on his business "credibility." but his business record matches his character: his only concern is his own profit.
i want to thank bernie sanders. bernie, your campaign inspired millions of americans. 
lying about veterans, his business, and his own words—and that wasn't even the worst thing trump said this week.
a new dad wrote to hillary about his hopes for his family:
a retired auto worker on why she’s for hillary: “i like her strength even though she went through some challenges.”
i’ve been called a lot of things over the years, but ‘unqualified’ has not been one of them.

our campaign is about restoring people’s confidence in our ability to solve problems together 
i’m running for young people like so many of you who dream of changing our world for the better. 
when a candidate for president says we can solve america’s problems by building walls and discriminating, new yorkers know better.
we can't harness change and solve problems if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.

nobody's attacking the second amendment. we can protect americans' rights—and also protect families from gun violence.
all americans stand united with the people of turkey against this campaign of hatred and violence. 
if donald trump doesn’t respect all americans, how can he serve all americans?
here's how the republican ticket would "protect" lgbt americans.

donald trump is not only putting our national security at riske’s putting our economy at risk.
donald trump's made the most reckless statements on national security by any major candidate in modern history:
watch hillary become the first woman presidential nominee of a major political party:
...and that's why you don't try to pick a fight on women's economic security with hillary clinton.
"no major party nominee in the history of this nation has known less or been less prepared to deal with...national security" —biden on trump
donald trump told lie after lie last night because it's all he has to offer the american people.

hillary at tonight’s  :
whenever you hear trump talk about foreign policy, picture him in the situation room making decisions for all of us.
true on foreign policy—and literally everything else.
donald trump's foreign policy isn't just offensive, it's dangerous.
america "has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy...i know it’s possible to find common ground because i’ve done it."
why do trump’s foreign policy ideas read like a putin wish list?
it’s not the big banks that need relief from washington—it’s small banks and small businesses.
we already have dodd-frank. we need to go further to tackle dangerous risks in the big banks—and outside the big banks.
we need to rein in risk on wall street, and make sure middle class american families never have to bail it out again.

donald trump spoke for 75 minutes and offered zero solutions.  on trump’s convention speech:
under @potus and @joebiden , we’ve had 75 straight months of job growth. i want us to see 75 more. 
i want to thank bernie sanders. bernie, your campaign inspired millions of americans. 
q: "saying [a judge] can't do his job because of his race—is that not the definition of racism?" trump: "no."
hillary believes that what’s good for women is good for america.
a bernie sanders supporter asked hillary a questionere’s what he thought of her response:
33,000 americans die from gun violence each year. no other developed country comes close.
we need to rein in how much higher education costs . it’s time for a new college compact that makes education available to all.

flint families have waited long enough for the help they need. no more excuses—the senate should pass the bipartisan aid bill before it. 
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
thank you, @potus .
thank you, @berniesanders . thank you for your leadership and your support in this campaign. 
thank you, @joebiden .
thank you, @theellenshow .
thank you, president carter.
we heard the man from hope, bill clinton. and the man of hope, barack obama. 
there is something wrong with our country. there is too much violence...too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn’t be.
the other side is not talking issues—they're talking insults. 
trump's candidacy is built on his business "credibility." but his business record matches his character: his only concern is his own profit.
on  , celebrate your right to vote by making sure you're ready to exercise it:
the ability to exercise your reproductive rights should be a reality for all, not just those who can afford it.
no matter how great the challenge, america must lead.  to the @americanlegion
donald trump told lie after lie last night because it's all he has to offer the american people.
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
4. if you were willing to work with qaddafi—a known terrorist and dictator—is there anyone you aren't willing to make a deal with? who?
hillary to 650+ house parties nationwide: "it's about you, about us, about all the people who deserve a champion."
now we know what trump really thinks about us. sad!
next week, hillary will walk on stage for the first presidential debate. chip in now for the chance to be there:
"if the medicine you need costs less in canada, you should be able to buy it from canada—or any country that meets our safety standards."

hillary's speaking at the @vfwhq . tune in now:
relieved atlantic drilling is now off the table. time to do the next right thing and protect the arctic, too.  
there is no other donald trump. this is it.
can we get back to politics, please? (great job, @hamiltonmusical .)
. @realdonaldtrump : “i’m the last person she wants to run against."
to the lgbt community: please know that you have millions of allies across our country. i am one of them. 
hillary on the faith that drives her: "do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can."
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
for the first time in our history, a woman will be a major party’s nominee for president of the united states.
can a muslim be president of the united states of america? in a word: yes. now let's move on. 
i accept your nomination for president of the united states! 
we cannot afford to have a republican succeed barack obama as president of the united states.
donald trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states.
we are better than this.
we're better than this.
we’re better than this.
donald trump launched his campaign one year ago this week. and what a year it’s been.
it’s time for us to say, wait a minute. we’re better than this. our country is better than this.  on gun violence

donald trump is not who we are.
he’s a statesman—leading not just our country but the entire world. this is a president who knows how to keep us safe and strong. 
our values are stronger than fear. slamming the door on refugees isn’t who we are.  3-40de-8cb5-b81b11ba4bd7 …
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
our economy—and country—are better off thanks to president obama and hardworking americans. anyone who says otherwise is wrong.
an iowa tradition: hillary is speaking to @iowademocrats at their annual hall of fame dinner. watch live now:
for too long, issues affecting women and families—from childcare to paid leaveave been dismissed as women's issues. those days are over.
for too long, issues affecting women—from reproductive rights to paid leaveave been dismissed as women's issues. those days are over.
equal pay, paid leave, childcare: these aren't just "women's issues," they're family issues and economic issues.

trump "doesn’t have a clue about the middle class… “he has no clue about what makes america great. actually, he has no clue—period." —biden
anybody who thinks that they can influence what i will do doesn't know me very well. 
wishing everyone the best this kwanzaa. to all celebrating—bill and i send you our warmest wishes. 
yes—black lives matter.  at
"yes, the world is watching what we do. yes, america's destiny is ours to choose. so let's be stronger together my fellow americans!"
"you have made me a better person and helped me believe i can do anything."
anybody who thinks that they can influence what i will do doesn't know me very well. 
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
it’s not just that trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to national security. his words are dangerous, and they hurt us.
he sure doesn’t speak for me, because i know we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re going to be.  on trump
this was an act of terror. ... this was also an act of hate.  on the attack in orlando
we can’t go back to the old policies that failed us before.
these things can be true at once: we need criminal justice reform. we need to support police. we need to do more to stop gun violence.
like all americans, my thoughts are with those who were wounded, their families, & our first responders  on this weekend’s attacks
thinking about the people of both italy and myanmar as they respond to today's earthquakes. my heart goes out to the victims’ families. 
wishing all korean americans and their families a safe and happy chuseok!
"the second fight is to strengthen america's families, because when our families are strong, america is strong."
sybrina, you and all mothers of gun violence victims have taught us hate will never win. thinking of you today.  
we heard the man from hope, bill clinton. and the man of hope, barack obama. 
the uninsured rate is the lowest in decades, but prescription costs, out-of-pocket costs, and premiums are growing. we need to do better.
there is so much more that unites us than divides us. that's why we're the greatest country on earth.
to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. you need both understanding and action. 
"trump just criticized me for preparing for this debate. you know what else i prepared for? being president."
"i know what it's like to go into the primaries up. and i know what it's like to come out of them down."
hillary for america. let’s go.
arizona, go vote today! retweet to let everyone know you’re with her.
instead of shouting about what's wrong with america, let's make it work for everyone.
are you with hillary? let her know:
i accept your nomination for president of the united states! 
there’s no place for second-class status in the united states of america.
donald trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states.
donald trump is totally unfit and unqualified to be president of the united states:
"the united states needs to lead in the americas. and if we don't, make no mistake—others will."
this shouldn't have to be said: you don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. it doesn’t work. no one buys it.
economists project that trump’s plans would add more than $5,000,000,000,000 to the national debt. that's "trillion" with a "t."
to all of your supporters here and around the country: i want you to know, i've heard you.  on @berniesanders
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
i will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. 
no matter where you live, you can make sure you're registered to vote at  .
a progressive who gets things done? make that two.
president obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done. 
i'm a progressive, but i'm a progressive who gets things done. 
why has hillary received the endorsements of so many papers that backed @potus ? she gets things done.
thank you, @potus .
thank you, @berniesanders . thank you for your leadership and your support in this campaign. 
thank you, @joebiden .
thank you, @theellenshow .
thank you, president carter.
here's how the republican ticket would "protect" lgbt americans.
on day three, the  officially welcomed @timkaine to the ticket—and @potus brought down the house:
new york is home to 20 million people. we don’t all look the same. we don’t all sound the same or worship the same, but we pull together.
hillary on the passing of rep. mark takai.
there is something wrong with our country. there is too much violence...too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn’t be.
it's not just history that's watching us—it's the future, too.
it'd be all too easy for trump to roll back the progress we've made on lgbt rights. we can't give him the chance.
this primary is being decided state by state. help hillary win in three easy (seriously, easy) steps:
it's easy to say you'll fix wall street—it's harder to actually do it. hillary has a plan to get it done.
start spreading the news.
what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
as an organizer in iowa, i spend my days talking to folks in my community about hillary and her vision for america.
"trump, the self-proclaimed tough negotiator, not only choked but openly lied about choking."
america needs leadership in the white house, not a liability.

we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
this isn't who we are, and it also isn't how we keep america safe.
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
i mourn for the officers shot while doing their sacred duty to protect peaceful protesters, for their families & all who serve with them. 
too many african american families are mourning. too many young black men and women have been taken from us.
"i’ve been called many things by many people. 'quitter' is not one of them."
. @oprah thank you. it’s an honor to have the support of someone who's shattered so many glass ceilings.
taking on systemic racism and rebuilding trust and respect between law enforcement and the communities they serve will require all of us.
i will bring law enforcement and communities together to develop national guidelines on the use of force by police officers. 
end mass incarceration. address inequality. restore trust between law enforcement & communities. read this & share:
we need strategies to fight crime & restore trust between law enforcement and our communities, especially communities of color.
trump's habit of projecting his actions onto someone else is what 6-year-olds call "i know you are, but what am i?"
trump’s tax plan could give his own family a $4 billion tax break. here's what we could do with that money instead:
under trump's tax plan, the wealthiest 0.1% of americans would get more tax relief than the bottom 60% combined.
quarterly capitalism—focusing only on short-term profits—is bad for wages, bad for business, and bad for our economy.
trump wants to eliminate the estate tax. what that would mean: his family gets a $4 billion tax cut. 99.8% of americans get nothing.
don’t let anyone tell you that our country is weak—we’re not. don’t let anyone tell you we don’t have what it takes—we do.

there’s no doubt about it—donald trump is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the united states.
trump on releasing detailed medical records: "i have no problem in doing so!" he still hasn't released them.
trump can't win tonight's debate by lying to the american people.
the american people have always made this country great.
what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.
every child in america deserves clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and a safe and healthy place to live.

americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.
today, hillary laid out her vision—and she's ready to fight for it. first stop: iowa.
hillary has only received one f in her life and she's proud of it: from the nra.
this young man’s story about depression is exactly why we can’t repeal or replace the affordable care act.
i've never known america to quit on ourselves. i've never known us to give up in the face of tough challenges. 
the affordable care act is working—and it's too important to repeal.
they couldn't take him on on the issues because they basically agreed with him.  on trump's @gop rivals:
for millions of moms and dads, if they get sick, they’re on their own. there’s no backup.
americans are hungry for solutions. they don’t just want us to diagnose problems, they want us to solve them.
every child should be able to live up to their god-given potential, no matter where they come from, what they look like, or who they love.
republican leaders should take a look at who they're standing with.
she told me that he was a great runner! i just thought, "how would this happen?" i knew it should happen, but i also knew the challenges.
if you're looking for someone to say what is wrong with america, i'm not your candidate. i think there is more right than wrong. 
we're not going to turn back the clock on progress.
it’s wrong to tear each other down. it’s wrong to let income inequality get worse. it’s wrong to put a loose cannon in charge.
we are not going to privatize the ., we’re going to reform it. 
so great to see @billclinton taking  on the road to india to talk about women in the economy.
try our new tool! see how much you'd pay in federal income taxes if you paid the same as "billionaire" donald trump:

in america, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you.
no one is too big to jail–even on wall street.
if you work on wall street and commit a crime, you deserve to go to jail.
no bank is too big to fail. no executive is too big to jail. 
why is hillary running for president? to be a champion for people like bethany:
there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too big to jail. 
i will miss my friend  . truly a  .
i believe every citizen has the right to vote, and i believe we should make it easier for every citizen to vote. 
hillary will fight to make it easier to vote—not harder.

that time donald trump gushed about one of the most shameful periods in our country’s history:
advice for kids: dress for the job you want.
. @jimmyfallon interviewed hillary for the job of president.
. @katyperry , you bring the campaign dress code to the next level. thanks for hanging out with us in iowa! 
i’m proud of the experience and judgment i would bring to this job. a president has to be able to do all parts of the job. 
hillary's on @linkedin ! (you may have heard—she's looking for a new job.)
this is what it would be like for a former secretary of state to be president:
hillary: “i’m excited to be here and i'm really excited about starting a campaign by talking to the people who really have a stake in it.”

hillary in new york yesterday:
it's great to be back on the campaign trail.
we need leaders...who put the interests of the american people ahead of their personal business interests.  at
can we get back to politics, please? (great job, @hamiltonmusical .)
"the last thing we need...is a president who doesn’t care about whether millions will lose access to health care coverage." —bernie on trump
she told me that he was a great runner! i just thought, "how would this happen?" i knew it should happen, but i also knew the challenges.
right before the housing market crashed, @realdonaldtrump said he hoped it would happen—because he could make money off of it.
don’t let anyone tell you that great things can’t happen in america.
marriage equality is the law of the land. officials don't have to agree—but they do have to uphold the law.
we must fight for criminal justice reform. everyone is safer when there is respect for the law and when everyone is respected by the law.

we've focused on issues. we share a lot of the same progressive goals; we have different ways of going about them. 
what trump just did is a disgrace.
it's a disgrace that the government is making money off of lending to college students. we need to end that.

"[hillary] is one of the most qualified people ever to run for the office, and she easily earns our endorsement.”
i accept your nomination for president of the united states! 
when you run for president of the united states, the entire world is watching.  on @realdonaldtrump 's dangerous rhetoric
"a person seeking to be the president of the united states should not suggest violence in any way."
donald trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states.
if donald trump doesn't show all americans the respect they deserve, he doesn't deserve to be their president.
republicans say the world doesn't respect us. the world disagrees.
we’ve got to build an economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect.
we’ve got to get back to a place where people listen to and respect one another.
let’s also put ourselves in the shoes of police officers. empathy works both ways. we’ve got to try to see the world through their eyes.

anyone who believes americans aren't working hard enough hasn't met enough american workers.
"every day, more americans are standing up and saying 'enough is enough'—including a lot of republicans. i’m honored to have their support."
“we endorsed her because she endorsed us.”

hillary this morning at the house select committee on benghazi.
did hillary rock at  ?
you can learn a lot about a person by the company they keep. here's some of the company trump keeps:
this is why i do it and this is who i’m in it for—to make life better for children and families. 
how many more of these do we have to sit through? asking for a friend.
good morning, new hampshire! see you at the polls.

he’s always doing that.
"he preyed on...people who had fallen on hard times. he’s conned them, he’s defrauded them, and he’s ripped them off.” —warren on trump
what he did here in atlantic city is exactly what he’ll do if he wins in november.  on @realdonaldtrump :
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.
some of america's most powerful women tell us why they support hillary:
on my way to @twitter ! tweet your questions to me with  & watch my conversation with @katies here:
chip in now, and you can always say you were one of the very first donors of the  campaign:
hillary and @berniesanders share a lot of big progressive goals—but they differ in how they plan to achieve them.
new york is a place to dream big—and we’re setting bold, progressive goals in this campaign. but new yorkers also like to get things done.
sen. sanders & i share big, progressive goals for our country—but i believe i’ve laid out stronger plans for how to achieve them. 
the other side is not talking issues—they're talking insults. 
we've got to keep talking about flint, and talking about real plans to make sure this never happens again. our kids deserve nothing less.
hard to believe they spent so much time talking about me and no time talking about jobs or education or health care.  on the rnc
student debt and the cost of college are incredibly important. why isn’t donald trump talking about these issues?
trump "doesn’t have a clue about the middle class… “he has no clue about what makes america great. actually, he has no clue—period." —biden
we need a president who understands that none of us has all the answers and no one person can fix our problems alone.
our economy—and country—are better off thanks to president obama and hardworking americans. anyone who says otherwise is wrong.
donald trump is closer than ever to clinching the gop nomination. there's only one candidate who has more votes.
here’s what you should know about the crisis in child care costs—and the one candidate who’s got a plan to fix it.

donald trump says he wants to make america great again—well, he could start by actually making things in america again.

"i have no doubt we can meet this challenge — if we meet it together." hillary's address on the orlando attack:
hey, have you joined  yet?
hillary's supporters have supporters of their own. here's some of the best fatherly advice you've passed along.
we need to start listening to each other. hearing each other. walking in each other’s shoes.
no one gets through life alone. we have to look out for each other and lift each other up. 
none of us gets through life alone. we all have to look out for each other and lift each other up.
let’s be more than allies to each other. let’s take on each other’s struggles as our own. 
this is the only comprehensive plan from a presidential candidate to support families with autism:
trump said the judge presiding over a lawsuit against trump u. should be disqualified from his job because of his “mexican heritage.”
it matters what we do, not just what we say. it didn’t matter what we called bin laden—it mattered that we got bin laden. 
"i know what it's like to go into the primaries up. and i know what it's like to come out of them down."
alton sterling matters. philando castile matters. black lives matter.
there’s nothing more important than protecting our kids. if we fail at that, it doesn’t matter what we get right.
anybody who thinks that they can influence what i will do doesn't know me very well. 
the children of flint are just as precious as the children of any other part of america.  in flint today
we need to help students who are also parents. when you help parents get an education, you're also helping their children.
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.

just yesterday, trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the united states.
for the first time in our history, a woman will be a major party’s nominee for president of the united states.
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc

one candidate made it clear he wasn’t prepared for last night’s debate. the other made it clear she’s prepared to be president.
hillary’s veterans plan will “ensure access to timely, high quality health care and modernize veterans’ benefits.”
taking care of our veterans is part of our solemn duty as americans:

economists project that trump’s plans would add more than $5,000,000,000,000 to the national debt. that's "trillion" with a "t."

last night, hillary was the only candidate to confront gop attacks on planned parenthood.
this isn't who we are, and it also isn't how we keep america safe.
donald trump is not who we are.
every day, donald trump proves that he’s not in this for the american people. he’s in it for himself. 
"donald trump doesn't see people like me, he only sees disability. i honestly feel bad for someone with so much hate in his heart."
did hillary rock at  ?
we need a president who can take on republicans and get the job done.
americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.
we need a president who doesn’t just rail against trade. we need a president who knows how to compete against the rest of the world and win.
democrats all agree that affordable health care should be a right. we need a real plan to get it done.
we know donald trump is not who we are. if you want to shut him down, then let’s vote him down.
america must continue to lead in a dangerous world. to do otherwise would mean drawing the wrong lesson from the benghazi tragedy.

advice for kids: dress for the job you want.
in a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside-in and the inside-out.
we have the most productive workers in the world. we just need to give our people a chance to succeed:

what's wrong with this picture?
you can tell a lot about someone by the company they keep.

we need leaders...who put the interests of the american people ahead of their personal business interests.  at
today, our public schools are more segregated than they were in 1968. that’s unacceptable for our kids and for our country.
it’s not just that trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to national security. his words are dangerous, and they hurt us.
the safety of our kids is more important than the interests of the nra. our leaders should act like it.

our next president could have the power to transform the supreme court for generations.
statement on the passing of supreme court justice antonin scalia:
we can be strong and smart without advocating torture or bigotry. we will not let fear dictate our foreign policy.
"we can’t let fear stop us from doing what’s necessary to keep us safe—nor let it push us into reckless actions that make us less safe."
we "can’t sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need. we must choose resolve—and we must lead the world to meet this threat."
trump doesn't represent us or our values. join the 100,000 people who have already signed our letter if you agree:
we have a sacred responsibility to those who serve and sacrifice for this country—today we remember and honor the values they fought for. 
we inevitably must accept a level of risk to protect our country and advance our interests and values. 
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.

you don’t make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great.  on donald trump
you don’t make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great in the first place.
getting rid of gun-free school zones. banning muslims entering the country. what you need to know about trump:
when it comes to women's health, there are two kinds of experts: women and their doctors. true 40+ years ago, true today. 
the next time trump throws a tantrum, picture him in the situation room making life-or-death decisions for us.

we've got to make this economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. :
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."

this fight is for all of us.

hillary: “i’m excited to be here and i'm really excited about starting a campaign by talking to the people who really have a stake in it.”
"as president, i’ll fight to put families first—just like i have my entire career."

45 reasons why trump should never be president—just from this week alone.
yesterday was a preview of what would happen under a republican president. every single gop candidate would defund planned parenthood. 
the fact is, trump isn't that different from every other republican candidate who would also outlaw abortion.
what would our country look like under a republican president? here’s a glimpse.
whoever goes up against donald trump better be ready. i am the best prepared candidate to do that. 
what would a state of the union be like under a republican president? here’s a disturbing preview.
economists project that trump’s plans would add more than $5,000,000,000,000 to the national debt. that's "trillion" with a "t."
4,000,000 followers. wow! thanks for joining us—  wouldn’t be the same without you.
i'm told the number just ticked over: as of a few minutes ago, 1,000,000 people have pitched in to be a part of this campaign. thank you. 
what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
marriage equality is the law of the land. deal with it.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
we watched the first night of the  so you didn't have to. some of the worst of what we heard:
hillary on the faith that drives her: "do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can."
a day to remember.
you want something to vote for, not just against: optimism, not resentment. answers, not anger. ideas, not insults. bridges, not walls.
you don't have to be lgbt to stand with the lgbt community. we all have a stake in equality. thank you, michael.
to the lgbt community: please know that you have millions of allies across our country. i am one of them. 
we did it, south carolina.

"i have no doubt we can meet this challenge — if we meet it together." hillary's address on the orlando attack:
there is no doubt in my mind that donald trump is unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief. 
everything you need to know before watching tonight's debate:
hillary: “i’m excited to be here and i'm really excited about starting a campaign by talking to the people who really have a stake in it.”
here's what we can't afford: a republican in the white house.
you literally said all those things.   p/status/738720347239809024 …

the terrorist in orlando targeted lgbt americans out of hatred and bigotry. an attack on any american is an attack on all americans.
medicare and medicaid have saved lives for half a century. an attack on them is an attack on seniors and vulnerable americans. 
this is a time to stand together and resolve to do everything we can to defend our communities and country.  on the attack in fl
watch live: hillary speaks on the terrorist attack in orlando →
a key difference between the two candidates at the  last night:
hillary at tonight’s  :
there are two candidates on stage at the  . only one is ready to be commander in chief.
two fewer candidates, but the same number of new ideas as the last  : zero.
she told me that he was a great runner! i just thought, "how would this happen?" i knew it should happen, but i also knew the challenges.
donald trump in the oval office is flat-out dangerous. we can’t let it happen.
president. donald. trump. get your free sticker to show the world you're not about to let that happen:
don’t let anyone tell you that great things can’t happen in america.
we should build a path to citizenship, not a wall on the border.

what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
hillary at tonight’s  :
it's hard to declare a "winner" in the  when every candidate is trying to move our country backward.
americans are hungry for solutions. they don’t just want us to diagnose problems, they want us to solve them.
we don’t want to turn against each other. we want to work with one another. we want to set big goals in this country.
i don't want to see us start over again. i want us to defend and build on the affordable care act and improve it. 
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
no wonder donald trump is hiding his tax returns.
for forty years, every presidential candidate has released their tax returns—except for trump. what's he hiding?
trump's detailed medical records are part of a laundry list of things he's hiding from the american public.
what hillary believes: no american should have to take out a loan to pay tuition at a public college.
putting hillary bold to good use.
this fight is for all of us.
people are angry. and they have every right to be. but i know they’re also hungry. they’re hungry for solutions. 
hillary is ready to fight for every single one of us. sign on if you're with her:

we don’t want to turn against each other. we want to work with one another. we want to set big goals in this country.
trump's rhetoric is shameful. it was one thing when he was a reality tv personality. it’s another when he’s running for president.
hillary on the gop debates: "it's reality tv—with a cast of characters who don't care much about actual reality."
this election isn’t a reality tv show. it shouldn’t be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get on cable news.
donald trump may think america is in decline, but he’s wrong. america’s best days are still ahead of us.
hillary for america. let’s go.
the house voting to defund planned parenthood is an attack on women's health—nothing more, nothing less. republicans should be ashamed.
we can take on the threat of climate change and make america a clean energy superpower. or, we can do nothing.
if we stand together, there's nothing we can't do. make sure you're ready to vote:

we need a fighter for children and families in the white house.
here's what we can't afford: a republican in the white house.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done.

had enough? do something about it:
this shouldn't have to be said: you don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. it doesn’t work. no one buys it.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done.

"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
you don’t make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great in the first place.

trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.
donald trump is proud of his recklessness—that’s his business. but when he’s running for president, it’s ours.
"workers are assets. investing in them pays off. higher wages pay off. and training pays off."
from ripping off veterans to demeaning women, trump spent the week insulting just about everyone:
gun violence is ripping apart people’s lives. they are trying to tell us. we need to listen. 
i've never known america to quit on ourselves. i've never known us to give up in the face of tough challenges.

a lesson from hillary's mom: "life's not about what happens to you. it's about what you do with what happens to you—so get back out there."
you can’t just talk someone into trusting you. you’ve got to earn it ... i believe what you say matters. 
it matters what we do, not just what we say. it didn’t matter what we called bin laden—it mattered that we got bin laden. 
"i know what it's like to go into the primaries up. and i know what it's like to come out of them down."
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
we need a president who will provide leadership that’s strong, smart, and steady. the last thing we need are leaders who incite more fear.

95 years ago today, women got one step closer to winning the right to vote. here’s to making history.
this fight is for all of us.
we have more to do for equality. we're going to fight for lgbt rights, women's rights, voting rights, workers' rights—and more.
it'd be all too easy for trump to roll back the progress we've made on lgbt rights. we can't give him the chance.
civil rights & voting rights. worker’s rights & women’s rights. lgbt rights and rights for people with disabilities. let's defend them all.
fired up. ready to go.

"to create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more americans."
hillary took donald trump's reckless economic policy to task in columbus today. it's worth watching:
we can't go back to cowboy diplomacy and reckless war-mongering...we need a foreign policy for the future.
this is only the beginning. we fought hard for every vote—now we take this campaign to the entire country.
the best way i can sum up what i hope this election will lead to...is: love trumps hate. 
the "winners" from last night's  :
if the young women of this country have donald trump as their president, what will they think of themselves?
this country belongs to all of us—not just to those at the top. not just to people who look one way, worship one way, or even think one way.
the wealthy should not be the only ones rewarded for our country's success.
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
this is just common sense. it's time for congress to act.
profit sharing is just common sense. see hillary's plan:
president obama’s job was to save us from a second great depression—and that’s exactly what he did. 
americans deserve a raise.
our teachers deserve more than just a pat on the back. they deserve a raise.
“you deserve justice, and you deserve equality under the law.”  2-425c-9dd3-48626ab414ef …
if donald trump doesn't show all americans the respect they deserve, he doesn't deserve to be their president.
our veterans deserve our thanks. you deserve a country that honors your service, not just with words but with deeds.
"her way of dealing with the stories she hears is not just to repeat the story but to do something about the story."
here’s why having a former secretary of state in the oval office would be a smart move:

you shouldn't have to worry about your paycheck or your job when you have a baby or someone in your family gets sick.
it's absolutely unacceptable that the gun industry can't be held accountable when they endanger americans.
gun dealers and manufacturers should be held accountable when they endanger communities.
gun manufacturers should be held accountable when they endanger americans. add your name if you agree:
it's important that people are held accountable for water poisoning in flint, but congress needs to act now to help flint families. 
gun dealers and manufacturers who endanger americans should be held accountable.
we should build a path to citizenship, not a wall on the border.
trump's wall on the border would likely cost at least $25 billion. some things we could do instead:

we're not going back, @realdonaldtrump .
we’re going to make our economy grow, but we’re also going to make it fair. here’s how:
"i lived through it, and there are photographs. and we're not going back to that."
if you like donald trump, you’re going to love his choice for vice president.
let's be clear: nothing—including an audit—is preventing trump from releasing his tax returns.
no wonder donald trump is hiding his tax returns.

this isn't who we are, and it also isn't how we keep america safe.
helping women & families succeed isn’t a side issue; it’s fundamental to our economic future.

it's great to be back on the campaign trail.
to be be great, we can’t be small. we can’t lose what made america great in the first place.
puerto ricans are citizens of america. they deserve to be treated as citizens. 
every person in this country deserves to be treated with respect. 
we need to work together to keep our country and our citizens safe. none of this will be helped by anything trump has to offer.

unity is better than division, empowerment is better than resentment, and bridges are better than walls.

we don’t want to turn against each other. we want to work with one another. we want to set big goals in this country.
i want the public to see my email. i asked state to release them. they said they will review them for release as soon as possible.
what donald trump did in atlantic city is nothing to brag about—it’s shameful—and every voter in america needs to know about it.

donald trump’s new message to african american voters isn’t just inaccurate. it’s outrageous.

republicans have a lot of nice things to say—when it's not an election year. thanks, mayor giuliani.

flint families have waited long enough for the help they need. no more excuses—the senate should pass the bipartisan aid bill before it. 
we need labor law reform. the  would protect workers' rights, now congress should pass it. 
"when all americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our country’s prosperity—that’s fair growth."

he is taking a hate movement mainstream. he has brought it into his campaign.  to @andersoncooper on trump
trump's statements are lies—but he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.
every day, donald trump proves that he’s not in this for the american people. he’s in it for himself. 
donald trump has a problem looking at someone different from himself and actually seeing them.

donald trump in the oval office is flat-out dangerous. we can’t let it happen.
this choice is pretty straightforward.
the choice on jobs in this election (it’s not a hard one).

trump says he hires the best people. this is what he means:
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.

donald trump says he wants to "make america great again." well, he could start by actually making things in america.
donald trump says he wants to make america great again—well, he could start by actually making things in america again. 
investing in our infrastructure is about more than creating good jobs: it’s about maintaining our status as the world’s economic superpower.
under trump, our economy would lose 3.5 million jobs. hillary's plan would create 10.4 million—in one term alone.
"building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset: our people—beginning with our youngest."
what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
trump's top adviser was designated $12.7 million from pro-russia forces in ukraine. that's the tip of the iceberg.

"you would think there is almost, like, something wrong." —donald trump on mitt romney failing to release his tax returns, 2012
every day, donald trump proves that he’s not in this for the american people. he’s in it for himself. 
he doesn’t speak for immigrants...i don’t think he speaks for women. i don’t think he speaks for working families.  on trump
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”

the feeling is mutual, nevada.
thanks to everyone who’s reached out with well wishes! i’m feeling fine and getting better. 
many people are saying trump won't release his tax returns because he's hiding something. what do you think it is?
no wonder donald trump is hiding his tax returns.
so what exactly is donald trump hiding from voters? pretty much everything.
for forty years, every presidential candidate has released their tax returns—except for trump. what's he hiding?
three pages of trump's tax returns confirm he's a business failure who's gotten rich at your expense. imagine what he’s hiding in the rest.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
if you like donald trump, you’re going to love his choice for vice president.
“i have this old-fashioned notion that if you’re running for president, you should say what you’re going to do.”
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.

these things can be true at once: we need criminal justice reform. we need to support police. we need to do more to stop gun violence.
we need more love and kindness in this country...the last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are. 
we need to make college more affordable.

joel sollender, wwii veteran and pow, on what it means when he hears trump insult our vets.
donald trump might have gone decades without paying taxes—but he’s not afraid of telling other people to pay theirs.
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
trump's attacks on women's health are just as bad as the rest of the gop candidates'.
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
as president, i will stand up to china and anyone else who tries to take advantage of american workers and companies. 
hillary on the enemies she's proud to have made: "the nra, health insurance companies, drug companies, the iranians...and the republicans."

if you're looking for someone to say what is wrong with america, i'm not your candidate. i think there is more right than wrong. 
thank you, @joebiden .
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
donald trump's business strategy: it's not about what you can build. it's about how much you can take.

hillary will protect women's ability to make their own health decisions. say you're with her:
what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.
trump talks about enacting extreme policy ideas that hurt americans. his vp pick has actually done it.
“as president, she won’t just say she’s going to do something. she will follow through and actually do it.”

an idea you won't hear at the  : if you work hard, you should be able to succeed—no matter who you are or where you come from.
a message to corporate america: if you cheat workers, customers, or taxpayers, we'll hold you accountable.

america never stopped being great. we just need to make it work for everyone.
"they shame and blame women rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions."
“hillary is the president we need for times like these.” —joseph from nyc
we need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyone’s experiences. 
donald trump may live in his own reality—but we've got his own words right here. check them out:
i'm a progressive who gets things done. cherry-picking a quote here or there doesn't change my record. 
"we should implement...commonsense reforms, including expanding early, absentee, and mail voting."
muslim americans: this is your country, too. i’m proud to be your fellow american. and many, many other americans feel the same way. 
some good advice from hillary.
economists project that trump’s plans would add more than $5,000,000,000,000 to the national debt. that's "trillion" with a "t."
florida, north carolina, ohio, illinois, missouri: we did it. and together, we're going to win this nomination.

hillary on the stakes of this election on @maddow tonight:
our elections should be shaped by voters' voices—not bought and sold by corporations & special interests :
we need leaders...who put the interests of the american people ahead of their personal business interests.  at
there are two candidates on stage at the  . only one is ready to be commander in chief.
sen. sanders talks a lot about stopping special interests for someone who's voted with the nra over and over again.
the fact that trump's answer to a question about racial injustice is just "we need law and order" pretty much says it all.
barack obama is president of the united states until january 20, 2017—that is a fact, whether the republicans like it or not. 
tearing up the iran nuclear deal isn't leadership—it's recklessness.
i want to thank bernie sanders. bernie, your campaign inspired millions of americans. 
donald trump called the trump plaza casino and hotel "the biggest hit yet." now, it's abandoned.

how do you know hillary will fight for equal pay? she's been doing it for years. learn about her record and ideas:
promising to carpet bomb until the desert glows doesn’t make you sound strong—it makes you sound like you’re in over your head. 
"the president for small business"—like the sound of that.
we need to say loudly and clearly: we will not let wall street wreck main street again.
"these are not only problems of economic inequality. they are problems of racial inequality. we’ve got to say that loudly and clearly."
despite our best efforts and our highest hopes, america’s long struggle with race is far from finished.
to south carolina, to the volunteers at the heart of our campaign, to the supporters who power it: thank you. 
hillary's supporters have supporters of their own. here's some of the best fatherly advice you've passed along.
want to do more to support  ? you're in luck:
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done.

eight years ago today.
when it comes to gun violence, we cannot give up. we can't sit by while more good people die. we have to act.
donald trump is unfit to be president. we just can’t accept this. we’ve got to stand up to this. if we don’t, it won’t stop.
this is why i do it and this is who i’m in it for—to make life better for children and families. 
take it from @flotus : this election is too important to sit out. register to vote:
we need to pay our teachers like the future of our country is in their hands—because it is.
hillary's supporters have supporters of their own. here's some of the best fatherly advice you've passed along.
...and while we're at it...

i will keep doing what i’ve done my entire life. i will keep standing up for you. i will keep fighting for you. 
whoever goes up against donald trump better be ready. i am the best prepared candidate to do that. 
i can’t think of any better person to have by my side on the campaign trail and in the white house. 
when a candidate for president says we can solve america’s problems by building walls and discriminating, new yorkers know better.
this is just common sense. it's time for congress to act.
we need a leader on women's health—not just somebody who votes right, but somebody who leads the effort.
you can go to  to make sure you are registered. and i hope you all will. 
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
if you are too dangerous to fly in america, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in america. 
we need to find the right balance between civil liberties and national security.
donald trump's made the most reckless statements on national security by any major candidate in modern history:
trump's global web of financial and business ties would compromise our national security if he’s elected president.
50 gop national security experts said they will not vote for trump because he would be “the most reckless president in american history.”
it’s not just that trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to national security. his words are dangerous, and they hurt us.
hope you have this much fun this weekend.

"clinton is one of the brightest people in congress & she would be an excellent choice” —sen. sanders on hillary as sec. of state, nov. 2008
i won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign. 
hillary's pinning her way across america! follow her on the campaign trail:
many of the major newspapers that backed @potus in 2008 are supporting hillary now. here's why:
national political director @amandarenteria went with hillary to flint, michigan. here's what she saw.
we're going to fight for real solutions that make a real difference in people's lives.
to keep america safe, we need real leadership—not hateful rhetoric.
we can't afford a president who won't admit climate change is real. it's real. it's a fact. and we will take action.

if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
if you want a president who will listen to you, work her heart out to make your life better—then you’re lookin’ at her.
we don’t want to turn against each other. we want to work with one another. we want to set big goals in this country.
i want to get comprehensive immigration reform. and i want to start trying to get it as soon as i'm elected, if i'm so fortunate. 
here's what people with actual "tremendous business success" say about donald trump.
i believe with all my heart that america is better than this. america is better than donald trump. 
education should be about building a brighter future, not a lifetime of debt.
we are going to end the federal government making money off of lending money to get your education.
we need to rein in how much higher education costs . it’s time for a new college compact that makes education available to all. 
access to higher education should be a right, not a privilege for those who can afford it.
i've never known america to quit on ourselves. i've never known us to give up in the face of tough challenges. 
reproductive freedom should be a reality for all, not a luxury for those who can afford it. i'll never give up until it is.  
consider this a message to 7-year-old you: don't give up. (and yes, that's his real name—give or take a vowel.)  f/status/600376435581259776 …
we cannot give up on preventing gun violence. we—and our next presidentave to stand up to the nra.
our country can't live up to its potential unless we give every american a chance to live up to theirs.
if you see bigotry, you should oppose it. if you see violence, you should condemn it. if you see a bully, you should stand up to him.
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done.

if we resist the forces trying to drive us apart, we can come together to make this country work for everyone.
i don’t know about you, but we’re fired up and ready to go! 
putting hillary bold to good use.
new york is a place to dream big—and we’re setting bold, progressive goals in this campaign. but new yorkers also like to get things done.

in america, we don't say, “i alone can fix it.” we say, "we'll fix it together.”
americans don’t say: “i alone can fix it.” we say: “ok, how are we going to fix this together?”
americans don’t say, 'i alone can fix it.' they say, ‘we’ll fix it together!’ 
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.
we need to raise the minimum wage so nobody who works full-time is still in poverty:
we "can’t sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need. we must choose resolve—and we must lead the world to meet this threat."
when we work together, we will trump hate.
fixing our immigration system will strengthen families, our economy, and our country.
hillary on reforming our criminal justice system, rebuilding respect, and embracing our common humanity:
we are americans. we will not turn on each other or our principles. that's how we win.

when it comes to preventing gun violence, we cannot give up.
it’s not just that trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to national security. his words are dangerous, and they hurt us.

hillary on what she's fighting for: "at the top of the list is this: americans need a raise."
donald trump is responsible for what happens at his events. he’s been not just inciting violence, but applauding it. 
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.

if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
if you could tell hillary why you're on her team, what would you say?
if you like donald trump, you’re going to love his choice for vice president.
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.
we are not going to let donald trump bankrupt america the way he bankrupted his casinos.
@potus nice job last night. aunt hillary approves.  
this is why i do it and this is who i’m in it for—to make life better for children and families. 
"as president, i’ll fight to put families first—just like i have my entire career."
hillary's been fighting for women and girls her entire career—and she's just getting started.
"when all americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our country’s prosperity—that’s fair growth."
i’ve been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life and i’m not going to stop now. in iowa
"the third key driver of income gains alongside strong growth and fair growth must be long-term growth."
donald trump told lie after lie last night because it's all he has to offer the american people.
hillary at tonight’s  :
as @flotus said, the choice in this election is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives.
a republican president could nominate as many as 4 supreme court justices. why that should terrify you:
a republican president could nominate as many as four supreme court justices. why that should terrify you:
a republican president could stack the supreme court with justices who will rip away all of the progress we’ve made.
it's @potus ' job to nominate supreme court justices, and the senate has a responsibility to vote.
supporting planned parenthood, the aca, and supreme court justices who will protect americans' rights? count on it.
i’ve been called a lot of things over the years, but ‘unqualified’ has not been one of them. 
america has always been a country of "we," not "me." and we've always been stronger together.
there is something wrong with our country. there is too much violence...too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn’t be.
no company in america should be able to pay women less for the work they do.
among the top issues hillary will work toward in her first 100 days as president: "finally, getting equal pay for women's work."
when we work together, we will trump hate.
for  , i celebrate the work of eleanor roosevelt, a courageous advocate for human rights. her work continues to inspire.
there are just 39 days between now & november 8. just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.
it matters what we do, not just what we say. it didn’t matter what we called bin laden—it mattered that we got bin laden. 
when our seals took out bin laden, they brought the terrorists' families to safety first. that's american honor.
we watched the first night of the  so you didn't have to. some of the worst of what we heard:
the "winners" from last night's  :
we can’t go back to a foreign policy that views us boots on the ground as a first choice instead of a last resort.
tune in now to watch @joebiden hit the trail for hillary in ohio:

america has always been a country of "we," not "me." and we've always been stronger together.
i’ve been called a lot of things over the years, but ‘unqualified’ has not been one of them.

one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."

this is what we're fighting for in nevada.
president trump? cruz? rubio? carson?
the choice on jobs in this election (it’s not a hard one).
we can’t go back to a foreign policy that views us boots on the ground as a first choice instead of a last resort.
military action should be the last resort—not the first choice. 
an idea you won't hear at the  : if you work hard, you should be able to succeed—no matter who you are or where you come from.
the next president has to be able to stand up to republicans and stop their backward agenda.

one candidate made it clear he wasn’t prepared for last night’s debate. the other made it clear she’s prepared to be president.
the force is strong with this one.
we can dream big and fight for progressive values—and make a real difference in americans' lives. that is what we will do.
chip in $1 before 2016 to keep the momentum going!
we've got to keep going, keep working, keep breaking down those barriers and imagine what we can build together.
i will keep doing what i’ve done my entire life. i will keep standing up for you. i will keep fighting for you. 
tonight's victory belongs to everyone who worked hard to get out the vote. sign up now to keep the momentum going.

our goal is not to deter or contain isis, but to defeat and destroy isis. 
this is not a time for scoring political points... this is a time for american leadership.  on defeating isis & the refugee crisis
"americans now have to move from fear to resolve." hillary on her plan to defeat isis:
it is not enough to contain isis—we must defeat isis. break its momentum, and then its back. 
trump "doesn’t have a clue about the middle class… “he has no clue about what makes america great. actually, he has no clue—period." —biden
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
a lesson from hillary's mom: "life's not about what happens to you. it's about what you do with what happens to you—so get back out there."
if you want to go to college or are saddled with student debt, you'll want to read what @timkaine has to say:
thanks for having our back, kentucky.
the new jobs report confirms: the economy is stronger with a democrat in the white house.
we're not at war with a religion. we're at war with radical jihadism. hillary knows the difference.
we're not at war with a religion; we're at war with radical jihadism. muslim americans: this is your country too.
just yesterday, trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the united states.
in america, we don't say, “i alone can fix it.” we say, "we'll fix it together.”
americans don’t say: “i alone can fix it.” we say: “ok, how are we going to fix this together?”
"voters can count on her to bring that same passion for getting the job done to the white house."
americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.
we need a president who can take on republicans and get the job done.
a key difference between the two candidates at the  last night:
i’m proud of the experience and judgment i would bring to this job. a president has to be able to do all parts of the job. 
a key difference between the two candidates at the  last night:
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
it's almost as if trump only cares about himself.  /status/747756529353392128 …
if you stand for equal rights, if you stand against discrimination, you don't just do it once—you've got to keep fighting. 
if you see bigotry, you should oppose it. if you see violence, you should condemn it. if you see a bully, you should stand up to him.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
an idea you won't hear at the  : if you work hard, you should be able to succeed—no matter who you are or where you come from.
if you could tell hillary why you're on her team, what would you say?
if donald trump doesn’t respect all americans, how can he serve all americans?
this fight is for all of us.

marriage equality is the law of the land. officials don't have to agree—but they do have to uphold the law.
marriage equality is the law of the land. deal with it.
i won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign. 
don’t believe anyone who says 'i alone can fix it.’ yes, those were actually donald trump’s words in cleveland. 
there are more mass shootings in the united states than any other country in the world...we cannot accept this. not now—not ever. 
we cannot afford to have a republican succeed barack obama as president of the united states.
politics are hard. but when it comes to gun violence, we cannot give up. we cannot sit by while more good people die. we must keep going.
there’s no place for second-class status in the united states of america.

yes, we need to crack down on wall street—but that's not enough. we need to go after corporations that hurt families.
humility is not something you hear much about in politics, is it? but we should. none of us is perfect. 
at this point, donald trump has insulted the vast majority of americans. the good news is, there's something we can all do about it: vote.

"trump is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security." —michael morell
talking about a vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat the threat of terrorism we face today.

what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.

military action should be the last resort—not the first choice. 
it's not just history that's watching us—it's the future, too.
our veterans and military families deserve better.
our veterans have done so much for us; now we need to do more for them. read hillary’s op-ed in the @militarytimes :
hillary’s veterans plan will “ensure access to timely, high quality health care and modernize veterans’ benefits.”
donald trump says he supports our veterans, but he's taken advantage of them time and time again.
today, we'll hear trump talk about our veterans. our new ad on what they've been hearing from trump for months:
"if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. and when you get ahead, america gets ahead."
what this campaign is about: building a future where every american has the opportunity to get ahead and stay ahead.
bottom line: when women get ahead, america gets ahead.

let's make america a world leader in manufacturing, again.
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
we heard the man from hope, bill clinton. and the man of hope, barack obama. 
"this has been such an exciting...week! we heard the man from hope, bill clinton & the man of hope, barack obama."
we don’t want to turn against each other. we want to work with one another. we want to set big goals in this country.
here's how hillary's fighting to make the economy work for all americans—not just those at the top:
a day to remember.
. @realdonaldtrump : barack obama is your president too.
no, barack obama is not the founder of isis.
it's not just history that's watching us—it's the future, too.
donald trump is not who we are.
"you want to give me a good send-off? go vote.” —barack obama:
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
trump's attacks on women's health are just as bad as the rest of the gop candidates'.
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.

latinos have to help us shape the future of america because you are the future of america.  at @lulac
you don't just deserve a seat at the table. it's past time you had a fair chance to run the meeting.  to the black women’s agenda
the best way to help louisianans affected by terrible flooding is to make sure they have the resources they need:
good morning, new hampshire! see you at the polls.
hillary this morning at the house select committee on benghazi.
we have to end the era of mass incarceration. 
"if we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers."
she told me that he was a great runner! i just thought, "how would this happen?" i knew it should happen, but i also knew the challenges.
we can't accept this as "normal."
i refuse to accept this as normal. we must take action to stop gun violence now.   /672139564346187776 …
hillary is fighting for all of us.
this is what we're fighting for in nevada.
so if fighting for women is playing the  , well...
trump’s calls to torture and mistreat prisoners go against the very values we are fighting to defend. we’re better than this.
commercial break: hillary is fighting for equal pay for women. republicans are fighting against it.   a-49c0-9fbb-a15eb0117ac8 …
"you have made me a better person and helped me believe i can do anything."
trump's statements are lies—but he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.
when we join together, we can’t be beat. say you’re on team  :
after stoking every fire he can think of, trump encourages his supporters to beat up anybody who disagrees with him.  in oh
there is something wrong with our country. there is too much violence...too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn’t be.
while families are struggling to pay for child care, donald trump actually argued that americans are being paid too much.

we've heard way too much hateful rhetoric in this campaign. we need more love and kindness.  a-41f6-b600-c51c15bd2520 …
donald trump thinks americans are being paid too much and has hired union-busting firms to break up organizing campaigns on his properties.
"don’t attack women’s health care. and don’t shut down the government." hillary's message to republicans:
we know donald trump is not who we are. if you want to shut him down, then let’s vote him down.
the senate was right to block a resolution that would defund planned parenthood. now, stop these attacks—and don't shut down the government.
what the world needs now is love.
watch live now: hillary speaks on the iran deal →
an entire deck of woman cards? deal us in.
we’ve got to step up as a country and deal with this. the time to take action against the zika virus is right now.

“even if people don’t vote for me in november, i’m going to be for them and for you every single day.”
imagine trump sitting in the oval office the next time america faces a crisis. imagine him in charge, with your job and savings at stake.
next january, our next president will be sworn in. add your name if you think it should be hillary:
if you're with hillary, now is the time to stand up and say so. if you can, pitch in to show her you’re with her:
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
step 1: say you'll help hillary out:  step 2: have a great long weekend.
when you have a really, really good night.
we have to face the hard truths about race in america.
stronger together comes out in sept—a book on hillary's policy plans and vision for america:
"she promised me to block the constitutional amendment against gay marriage. and she did."
"they turn their backs on gay people who love each other."
marriage equality is the law of the land. deal with it.
"gay rights are human rights." watch how hillary helped advance gay rights around the world as secretary of state.  0-4b0d-a61b-2392953d227c …
all love is equal. it's time for marriage equality.  mnurw …
it's time to choose once and for all: will we stand with the nra, or stand up to it?
the nevada caucus is today! now is the time to stand with hillary. join the team:
if you see a bully, stand up to him.
he doesn’t speak for immigrants...i don’t think he speaks for women. i don’t think he speaks for working families.  on trump
one moment last night that proved—again—that hillary's the only candidate ready to lead on the global stage:
"it's about time this country had somebody running it who has an idea about money." —trump
about to head out and accept your nomination for president. i’m so grateful to everyone who made this moment possible. 
donald trump’s not just wrong about judge curiele’s wrong about america. he’s wrong about what makes this country great.
“you’re gonna make the same if you do as good a job.” —donald trump on women and equal pay
they're voting. are you? make sure you're registered:
and, unlike @realdonaldtrump , we're gonna make it easier for people who *aren't* celebrities to get apprenticeships.
if you like tweets from hillary, you're gonna love her texts. text "2016" to 47246 to get texts from  .
people are angry. and they have every right to be. but i know they’re also hungry. they’re hungry for solutions. 
4) hillary's not running to make a point—she's running to make a difference. she'll keep doing that. please feel free to keep tweeting.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
we'll pass a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united! 
"perhaps the best way to honor our police is to follow the lead of police departments across the country who are striving to do better."
i know we can protect our rights: women’s rights, gay rights, voting rights, immigrants' rights, workers' rights. 
barack obama is our president. he has a constitutional responsibility to fill [the supreme court] vacancy. he has exercised it. 
trump wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself. instead, let’s invest in our veterans, kids, schools and police.
setting the stage for the official  launch! tell us: i'm most excited about tomorrow because ________.

"don’t attack women’s health care. and don’t shut down the government." hillary's message to republicans:
unions helped build the middle class, so when republicans attack unions, they're attacking millions of americans.
...2) playing politics with trafficking victims… 3) threatening women's health & rights.
after battling it out in the primaries, hillary got a call from president obama to serve—and she answered.  7-4e80-961b-f35b2ed12d64 …
"she has so much compassion and it shows. she's a person, she's a grandmother, she's somebody's mother."

we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
you don’t make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great.  on donald trump
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
a wall that mexico will pay for: a bad idea from an even worse negotiator.
trump's "plan" to make mexico pay for a wall is ridiculous, offensive, and would punish kids & families. it's wrong.  24680449892353 …
the disastrous mexico wall trip: a case study in the trump school of diplomacy.
trump's calling for trillion dollar tax cuts for wall street. it's time for them to pay their fair share.
trump finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of mexico about building a wall. 
as your president, i will always have your back.

what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
it's 3:20am. as good a time as any to tweet about national service.
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
hillary believes that what’s good for women is good for america.

so far we’ve received nearly 9 million votes—more than a million more than donald trump and 2.5 million more than senator sanders.
"because of you, this campaign is the only one—democrat or republican—to win 10 million votes.”
there's only one candidate in this race with more votes than donald trump.
" @wired sees only one person running for president who can do the job: hillary clinton."
under trump, our economy would lose 3.5 million jobs. hillary's plan would create 10.4 million—in one term alone.

hillary will protect women's ability to make their own health decisions. say you're with her:
. @realdonaldtrump : barack obama is your president too.
no, barack obama is not the founder of isis.
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
trump's attacks on women's health are just as bad as the rest of the gop candidates'.
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
will repeat this as often as needed: women—not the politicians on stage—should make decisions about their own health.

one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
donald trump says he wants to make america great again—well, he could start by actually making things in america again.

“i have this old-fashioned notion that if you’re running for president, you should say what you’re going to do.”
one candidate would help millions of hardworking americans. the other would only help those at the top.
i’m running for young people like so many of you who dream of changing our world for the better. 
we need a president who sees the best in all of us.
what is the deal with donald trump and russia?

some folks may have the luxury to hold out for “the perfect.” but a lot of americans are hurting right now and they can’t wait for that.

. @jimmyfallon interviewed hillary for the job of president.
hillary wants to change how we think about business.
. @realdonaldtrump : “i’m the last person she wants to run against."
america has always been a country of "we," not "me." and we've always been stronger together.
trump wants to eliminate the estate tax. it would save the trump family $4 billion, but it would do nothing for 99.8% of americans.
i want to say: equality for women is so important to me. hillary's deep understanding—to live it and to understand it—means a lot to me.
trump's candidacy is built on his business "credibility." but his business record matches his character: his only concern is his own profit.
this dad is doing everything he can to make this country a better place for his daughters. read his letter to them:
what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.
a new dad wrote to hillary about his hopes for his family:
donald trump is proud of his recklessness—that’s his business. but when he’s running for president, it’s ours.
there is so much more that unites us than divides us. that's why we're the greatest country on earth.
americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.
"i strongly condemn the apparent terrorist attacks in minnesota, new jersey, and new york."
americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.
this shouldn't have to be said: you don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. it doesn’t work. no one buys it.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
you can’t just talk someone into trusting you. you’ve got to earn it ... i believe what you say matters. 
it's not enough for a president to stop bad things from happening...i think it's important to try to start good things.  in nh

i can’t think of any better person to have by my side on the campaign trail and in the white house. 
hillary on her vision for the country:
we are not going to privatize the ., we’re going to reform it. 
we're not going back, @realdonaldtrump .
we’re going to make our economy grow, but we’re also going to make it fair. here’s how:
"i lived through it, and there are photographs. and we're not going back to that."
if you like donald trump, you’re going to love his choice for vice president.
watch @elizabethforma live at the  in philadelphia:
true on foreign policy—and literally everything else.
donald trump’s not just wrong about judge curiele’s wrong about america. he’s wrong about what makes this country great.
the ideological bent of the supreme court has led our country in the wrong direction—stacking the deck in favor of the wealthy and powerful.
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
republicans say the world doesn't respect us. the world disagrees.
the "winners" from last night's  :
"you have made me a better person and helped me believe i can do anything."
"[hillary] tried to help the person that's less fortunate.”
america has never made progress by thinking one person alone can fix our problems.
we should change how we think about business.
hillary wants to change how we think about business.
we need more love and kindness in this country...the last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are. 
these things can be true at once: we need criminal justice reform. we need to support police. we need to do more to stop gun violence.
we need to make college more affordable.
a super quick update on the democratic primary race:
when you work hard, you should not be living in poverty.
your hard work should be reflected in a rising paycheck.
"when all americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our country’s prosperity—that’s fair growth."
it shouldn’t be so hard to be a working parent.

there's no better word for this than the one hillary just used: "outrage."
hillary made clear this week: what’s happening with the water in flint, michigan is an outrage.
this fight is for all of us.
what’s happening with the water in flint, michigan is an outrage.
this is why i do it and this is who i’m in it for—to make life better for children and families. 
one candidate would stand up for workers and their families. the other? not so much.
wishing my good friend the 68th  a very happy 70th birthday.
happy holidays! text holiday to 47246 to hear a message from hillary.

more than 1 in 100 american adults is behind bars. here's how we can start fixing that.
every time @realdonaldtrump makes you mad chip in $1.
when @realdonaldtrump makes you mad, chip in to make him…sad!
imagine this man in charge of our men and women in uniform.
hillary for america. let’s go.
there is no place in america for second-class citizenship.
there is no other donald trump. this is it.
hillary believes that what’s good for women is good for america.
there’s no place for second-class status in the united states of america.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
donald trump's business strategy: it's not about what you can build. it's about how much you can take.
“i have this old-fashioned notion that if you’re running for president, you should say what you’re going to do.”
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
"together we’re going to build an america where...a father can tell his daughter, 'you can be anything you want to be—including president.'"

donald trump is not only putting our national security at riske’s putting our economy at risk.
putting hillary bold to good use.
this fight is for all of us.
the "winners" from last night's  :
if you see bigotry, you should oppose it. if you see violence, you should condemn it. if you see a bully, you should stand up to him.

donald trump has no actual plan to create jobs.
thank you, @potus .
"to create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more americans."
donald trump wants to spend $3 trillion (yes, with a t) on tax cuts for people like him.
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
reason 3 of many why hillary should be our next president.
i believe every citizen has the right to vote, and i believe we should make it easier for every citizen to vote. 
comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together, and it’s the right thing to do. 
the president has to keep families safe and make the economy grow for everyone—not just those at the top.  7-4daa-9cdf-a52d14ddd101 …
when you work hard, you should not be living in poverty.
"more growth means more jobs and more new businesses."
woke up to hear the devastating news from fl. as we wait for more information, my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act. 
hillary at tonight’s  :
all of the other issues we want to deal with depend on our country being secure and strong. 
"that bargain has eroded. our job is to make it strong again."
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
we've got to keep talking about flint, and talking about real plans to make sure this never happens again. our kids deserve nothing less.
trump rails against other countries and talks about making america great, but his own products are made in places that aren’t named america.
i want to thank bernie sanders. bernie, your campaign inspired millions of americans. 
text qualified to 47246 if you agree there was only one candidate tonight who showed she's ready to be the next president.

trump's plan wouldn't just cut taxes for rich people—it would raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
anyone who wants to be president of this country should have a real plan to raise incomes, create jobs, and improve our economy.
trump's plan: cut taxes for billionaires & millionaires like him. raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
hillary is the only candidate on stage who has pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class.
americans need a raise.
it’s time to act on gun violence.
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is.

if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
many people are saying trump won't release his tax returns because he's hiding something. what do you think it is?
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.

in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
are you with hillary? let her know:
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
nobody here was “having fun” except for trump.
hillary has a three-part plan to defeat isis in the middle east, around the world, and here at home.
americans don’t say, 'i alone can fix it.' they say, ‘we’ll fix it together!’

you’re the reason we’re going to win this nomination and then win this election together.
did trump use his charitable foundation to prevent a state attorney general from investigating his fraud?
ask yourselves: what kind of justice would a president trump appoint? or for that matter, what kind of attorney general? 
donald trump's foundation allegedly paid off florida's attorney general to prevent an investigation into his fraud.

there's only one candidate in this election who's ready to be america's commander-in-chief.
are you ready for the first woman president?
donald trump is not only putting our national security at riske’s putting our economy at risk.
the united states is the only country in the developed world without guaranteed paid leave. that has to change.
hillary at the  .
hillary at the  :
a four-year degree shouldn’t be the only path to a good job. you should be able to learn a skill, practice a trade, and make a good living.
donald trump is totally unfit and unqualified to be president of the united states:
there are just 39 days between now & november 8. just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.
we can't harness change and solve problems if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.
proud to have senator reid on this team.
we can’t go back to the old policies that failed us before.
donald trump is not who we are.
your loved ones deserve the best care—without you having to worry about your paycheck.  a-4c91-8ae4-4a9e05112f8e …
what trump just did is a disgrace.
if you're looking for someone to say what is wrong with america, i'm not your candidate. i think there is more right than wrong. 
as a smart man once said, there’s nothing wrong with america that can’t be fixed by what is right with america. 
equal pay, paid leave, childcare: these aren't just "women's issues," they're family issues and economic issues.
equal pay, paid leave, childcare: these aren't just "women's issues," they're family issues and economic growth issues.

when you have a really, really good night.
a key difference between the two candidates at the  last night:
"i have a winning temperament." —donald trump last night really?
that is how progress gets made: we have to be both dreamers and doers.  last night in pa
hillary's been debating important issues since high school. let her know you’re on her team:
every child should have a path to success: pre-k:  school:  college:
hillary heard you: college costs are too high in america. it's time to fix it.
watch live → hillary sits down with dreamers at rancho high school in nevada to talk about immigration reform.
hillary’s college plan will help students preparing for college, those already in school, and those paying off debt.

we need to bring technical education back to our schools:
we love you back, @potus .

back at you, massachusetts.
we're not going back, @realdonaldtrump .
i will keep doing what i’ve done my entire life. i will keep standing up for you. i will keep fighting for you. 
we need a leader who will keep america safe and secure. add your name if you agree:
thank you, @berniesanders . thank you for your leadership and your support in this campaign. 
to keep america safe, we need leaders who will stand up against hateful proposals and reckless words.
“i will keep standing up for you. i will keep fighting for you." hillary’s remarks the night she won the
the republican party platform is so hateful, you'd think donald trump wrote it himself.
donald trump says wages are too high. really? hardworking americans don't think so.
do you think donald trump is qualified to be president? — @chriscuomo no, i do not. 
. @realdonaldtrump says he’ll be “the best for women.” don't think so.
donald trump is not who we are.
here’s what you need to know about hillary’s plan to keep america safe:
only one candidate in this race has a plan to tackle these issues. see how her plan would help you:
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.
unlike trump's, this plan to defeat isis isn’t a “secret.”
your first job can have a big impact on your life. read about hillary's plan to create jobs and invest in workers:
it took donald trump exactly one foreign policy trip to get rebuked by a leader of an ally nation.
with every republican attacking safe and legal abortion, women need more than an ally in the white house: we need a fighter.
we will not build a wall—instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one. 
everyone who works hard and does their part should be able to say, “i can make it in america.”
when you have a really, really good night.
we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.
everyone who works hard and does their part should see that work reflected in a rising paycheck.
donald trump is not who we are.  in oh
hillary shared a few words to live by after winning the south carolina primary.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
there is no place in america for second-class citizenship. we can't wait any longer for comprehensive immigration reform.
when we come together, there's no problem we can't solve and no divide we can't heal.
there is no place in america for second-class citizenship.
violence has no place in our politics. we should use our words and deeds to bring americans together.
"it’s clear that the stakes in this election have never been higher. and the rhetoric we’re hearing on the other side has never been lower."
this is what it would be like for a former secretary of state to be president:
the world is a better place because hillary was secretary of state. here’s why:
president obama asked me to be his secretary of state. he valued my judgment. 
if trump needs help with diplomacy, he could learn a lot from our last secretary of state.
what would it mean to have a former secretary of state in the white house? this.
i believe every citizen has the right to vote, and i believe we should make it easier for every citizen to vote. 
"there is a co-worker i have who is male...i recently found out he was getting paid more than me. i was shocked.”
there is only one person who is ready to be commander in chief on stage at the  .
this fight is for all of us.

we need a president who doesn’t just rail against trade. we need a president who knows how to compete against the rest of the world and win.

someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.

this week, hillary spoke about breaking down barriers for african americans. here's how she did it in new york:
"last week...trump spoke for more than an hour...but other than talking about building a stupid wall…did you hear any actual ideas?" –warren
read more  stories and share your own:
did hillary rock at  ?
share this if you agree.
don’t live in iowa but want to help get out the caucus? retweet this to share with someone who does.
here's your must-read of the day:
hillary has always stood with planned parenthood—and always will.
it’s time for donald trump to be held to the same standard of disclosure as any other major party nominee.
we watched the first night of the  so you didn't have to. some of the worst of what we heard:
what would a state of the union be like under a republican president? here’s a disturbing preview.
this is just common sense. it's time for congress to act.
here’s what you should know about the crisis in child care costs—and the one candidate who’s got a plan to fix it.
proud to  in the fight for affordable health care. don’t mess with texas women's health.
profit sharing is just common sense. see hillary's plan:
only reaction to  ? bring it on.
donald trump's praise for brutal dictators like saddam hussein knows no bounds.
you have a problem when a candidate looks to saddam hussein and kim jong-un as examples of good leadership.
you don’t make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great in the first place.
to be be great, we can’t be small. we can’t lose what made america great in the first place.
hillary at tonight’s  :
well said, @jimmyfallon .
. @jimmyfallon interviewed hillary for the job of president.
rt this if you're proud to be standing with hillary tonight.
"please explain to me what part of america first leads him to make trump ties in china, not colorado. trump suits in mexico, not michigan."
"i'm most concerned about the kids who are left out and left behind."
the choice: hillary is standing up to the nra. senator sanders voted with them.
rt if you're standing with her all the way to the white house.
packed house waiting to hear hillary at the iowa launch party in des moines.
if you're standing with hillary today, let her know:
if you're with hillary, now is the time to stand up and say so. if you can, pitch in to show her you’re with her:
if you want a president who will listen to you, work her heart out to make your life better—then you’re lookin’ at her.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
you never know what you could be missing if you're not following the  flickr →
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
donald trump is not only putting our national security at riske’s putting our economy at risk.
watch this before you watch tonight's debate.
tonight, hillary will debate trump for the first time. follow @thebriefing2016 to make sure he's held accountable to the facts.
it’s great to be back on the campaign trail.  in north carolina. watch live:
to be be great, we can’t be small. we can’t lose what made america great in the first place.
i accept your nomination for president of the united states! 
barack obama is president of the united states until january 20, 2017—that is a fact, whether the republicans like it or not. 
when you run for president of the united states, the entire world is watching.  on @realdonaldtrump 's dangerous rhetoric
donald trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states.
we cannot afford to have a republican succeed barack obama as president of the united states.
if we’re serious about keeping our country safe, we also can’t afford to have a president who’s in the pocket of the gun lobby. 
"if we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers."
yes—black lives matter.  at
"yes, the world is watching what we do. yes, america's destiny is ours to choose. so let's be stronger together my fellow americans!"
i will bring law enforcement and communities together to develop national guidelines on the use of force by police officers.

"i ask you to do for hillary clinton what you did for me. i ask you to carry her the same way you carried me.”

just 98 days until election day. here are 98 things that depend on the choice we make on november 8:
donald trump's business strategy: it's not about what you can build. it's about how much you can take.
you can’t just talk someone into trusting you. you’ve got to earn it ... i believe what you say matters. 
let’s ask ourselves, what can i do to stop violence and promote justice? how can i show that your life matters to me? 
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
let's dispel with this fiction that @potus doesn't know what he's doing. he knows exactly what he's doing.
donald trump in the oval office is flat-out dangerous. we can’t let it happen.
we need to look to the future—not stay stuck in the past. watch hillary speak on cuba:
2015 is on track to be the hottest year on record. climate change is not only real, it's already present.
marriage equality is the law of the land. officials don't have to agree—but they do have to uphold the law.
america is one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. not just for people who look or worship a certain way.
latinos have to help us shape the future of america because you are the future of america.  at @lulac
after the events in paris and with thousands of gun deaths in the us each year, hard to fathom this from the gop.  
some of the toughest, hardest working leaders in america joined hillary on the campaign trail in new hampshire.

try our new tool! see how much you'd pay in federal income taxes if you paid the same as "billionaire" donald trump:
"they want to put immigrants who work hard and pay taxes at risk of deportation."
we're not going back, @realdonaldtrump .
we cannot go back to the failed policies of the past. we will not go back. america's best days are still ahead.
we’re not just going to break the glass ceiling. we’re going to break down all the barriers that hold back women and their families.
we love you back, @potus .
. @billclinton took over hillary’s snapchat to take you behind the scenes in iowa.
we are better than this.
i believe with all my heart that america is better than this. america is better than donald trump. 
unity is better than division, empowerment is better than resentment, and bridges are better than walls.
we’re better than that.

stop the delay, price gouging, and profiting off of others' illnesses. tell @martinshkreli to drop the price now.

families across america are feeling the strain from prescription drug price-gouging. here's how we'll take this on:
welcome to the team, @timkaine .
an attack on lgbt americans is an attack on all americans.  7-4058-a0b4-2ba0264d1aa7 …
attacks on planned parenthood are attacks on women's health and rights. we can't let them take us backwards.
medicare and medicaid have saved lives for half a century. an attack on them is an attack on seniors and vulnerable americans. 
the terrorist in orlando targeted lgbt americans out of hatred and bigotry. an attack on any american is an attack on all americans.
want to hear presidential candidates discuss how they'd combat the global threat of climate change? you’re out of luck at the  .
"investing in clean energy will: create millions of jobs let us lead the global fight against climate change"
republican candidates deny climate change because they’re “not scientists.”
how much more money would you have if you didn’t have student loan debt?
thank you, president carter.
trump or pence: who said it worse? it's a close call.
we have a choice: elect a president with years of experience working with other leaders to keep the world safe, or not.
republican leaders should take a look at who they're standing with.
you'll want to read the story behind this photo.
every american stands in strong solidarity with the people of france  on the attack in nice
just when you thought it couldn't get worse. horrific and telling.   us/715244637410041856 …
today's attack in baghdad is another horrific example of isis's savagery. we will defeat them. my prayers are with the victims' families. 
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
our next president has to bring our country together. we should be breaking down barriers, not building walls.
you can also listen to the first episode of with her by streaming here:
we must hold wall street accountable. read more from hillary's facebook q&a:
flint families have waited long enough for the help they need. no more excuses—the senate should pass the bipartisan aid bill before it.

"more growth means more jobs and more new businesses."
donald trump launched his campaign one year ago this week. and what a year it’s been.
starts the new year stronger than ever. to everyone who has supported this campaign: thank you.
sending warmest wishes to everyone celebrating the lunar new year! may you have peace and prosperity in the year ahead. 
we will not build a wall—instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one. 
a year from now, a new president will walk into the oval office. we can't afford to let it be a republican.
if you want to know what someone’s really like, ask his neighbors when he's not around.
"i ask you to do for hillary clinton what you did for me. i ask you to carry her the same way you carried me.”

i want to thank bernie sanders. bernie, your campaign inspired millions of americans. 
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
to be great, we can't be small. we have to be as big as the values that define america. 
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
thank you, @potus .
what’s happening with the water in flint, michigan is an outrage.
one of hillary's favorite moments from this week.
one year later (still one of our favorite maps).
hope you have this much fun this weekend.
. @glassdoor ’s ‘best places to work’ have one big thing in common–and it’s not just free coffee.
this is just common sense. it's time for congress to act.
profit sharing is just common sense. see hillary's plan:
this election is about who can get things done and build on the progress we’ve made.

what would our country look like under a republican president? here’s a glimpse.
. @potus is confirming what we know: our economy—and our country—are stronger under a democratic president.
america is one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. not just for people who look or worship a certain way.
we need to pay our teachers like the future of our country is in their hands—because it is.
we need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad. leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology. 
it's outrageous that many . moms have to go back to work a few weeks after having a baby—and too many dads get no parental leave at all.
this is a time to stand together and resolve to do everything we can to defend our communities and country.  on the attack in fl
donald trump may live in his own reality—but we've got his own words right here. check them out:

the world is a better place because hillary was secretary of state. here’s why:
seven reasons the world is a better place because hillary was secretary of state:

no american should have to choose between getting the health care they need and paying rent.
we need more love and kindness in this country...the last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are. 
we have to decide whether we’re going to work together so we can all rise together. 
when we work together, we will trump hate.
if we work together, we can change history. chip in today and get your sticker:
reauthorizing @eximbankus means supporting america's small businesses. time for congress to put politics aside & act.
we need a president who can take on republicans and get the job done.

rape is a crime—wherever it happens. 
"my primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the united states."
protecting communities should be our number one priority—not the interests of the nra.
four years as secretary of state—she's got a bit of experience on foreign policy.
a reminder of what a presidential candidate with real foreign policy experience looks like   6/status/676961083794542592 …
on foreign policy, the use of force should always be the last resort—not the first choice. 
the president doesn't get to choose what issues come to her desk. navigating foreign policy challenges is part of the job.
i’m proud of the experience and judgment i would bring to this job. a president has to be able to do all parts of the job. 
your student debt collector would really like you not to vote for hillary.
the american people deserve something to vote for, not just against. 
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
small businesses are the backbone of our economy. we should focus on supporting them—not stiffing them.
we’re stronger together. when we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them. when we build bridges, not walls.
when we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future.
we should support our teachers, not scapegoat them.
we can’t cozy up to dictators; we have to stand up to them. we can’t contain isis; we must defeat it. and we will.
a day to remember.
we cannot let donald trump become the next president.
we cannot let wall street wreck our economy ever again.
let’s go forward. let’s win the nomination. 
don’t let anyone tell you that great things can’t happen in america.

president obama doesn't get the credit he deserves. his accomplishments shouldn't be up for debate at a  .
happy father's day, @billclinton !
some of the (many, many) reasons donald trump isn't fit to be commander-in-chief.
trump on releasing detailed medical records: "i have no problem in doing so!" he still hasn't released them.
trump's detailed medical records are part of a laundry list of things he's hiding from the american public.
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
in school, i learned how to think creatively and stand up for myself.  don't have that chance.  
this campaign is about making sure there are no ceilings—no limits—on any of us. 
there is no other donald trump. this is it.
we have to stand up to this hate. we have to send a clear message: america is better than this. america is better than donald trump.
it's time to choose once and for all: will we stand with the nra, or stand up to it?
it’s time to pick a side: stand with the gun lobby or stand up to it.
humbled to stand with these women, who have turned unimaginable grief into a call to action we all need to hear.   0-44cc-a28f-cad9c7e5af00 …
“it's time we stand up to the gun lobby and stand with parents who have lost their children to gun violence.”
wishing everyone the best this kwanzaa. to all celebrating—bill and i send you our warmest wishes. 
my best wishes to those celebrating the end of the holy month of ramadan. eid mubarak. 
congratulations on your emmy, kate! big fan of yours, too.
happy birthday, kate mckinnon! the feeling's mutual.
the affordable care act is working—and it's too important to repeal.
it is both heartbreaking and infuriating that we lose an average of 90 americans every day because of guns. 
today's attack in baghdad is another horrific example of isis's savagery. we will defeat them. my prayers are with the victims' families. 
there are more mass shootings in the united states than any other country in the world...we cannot accept this. not now—not ever. 
happy first day of summer.

americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.
reproductive freedom should be a reality for all, not a luxury for those who can afford it. i'll never give up until it is.  
not one living president has said they believe donald trump has what it takes to be commander-in-chief.
don’t let anyone tell you that our country is weak—we’re not. don’t let anyone tell you we don’t have what it takes—we do.
hillary worked to expand health care for millions of children:
when americans get knocked down, we get right back up again. we refuse to quit—no matter what. that’s the spirit we need in this election.
if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.

we have to decide whether we’re going to work together so we can all rise together. 
let's dispel with this fiction that @potus doesn't know what he's doing. he knows exactly what he's doing.
we lost many brave americans on september 11, 2001—and in the years since, because of it. today we mourn and honor them. 
eight years ago today.
we have a sacred responsibility to those who serve and sacrifice for this country—today we remember and honor the values they fought for.

there's no excuse for racism and violence on a college campus.  
there is no excuse for violence inside a school. the  is unacceptable—schools should be safe places. 
there is no excuse for letting greed get in the way of people's health. companies like these should be ashamed.

4,000,000 followers. wow! thanks for joining us—  wouldn’t be the same without you.
hard to believe they spent so much time talking about me and no time talking about jobs or education or health care.  on the rnc
"i will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive actions that would put dreamers—including many with us today—at risk of deportation"
the other side is not talking issues—they're talking insults. 
we've got to keep talking about flint, and talking about real plans to make sure this never happens again. our kids deserve nothing less.
we face serious challenges in the world—but americans will not turn on each other, turn on our allies, or turn away from our principles.
fired up. ready to go.

this campaign, in 100 amazing photos.
one million people have donated to help elect hillary, and a majority of those donations were $100 or less.
this country belongs to all of us—not just to those at the top. not just to people who look one way, worship one way, or even think one way.
americans are hungry for solutions. they don’t just want us to diagnose problems, they want us to solve them.
americans don’t say, 'i alone can fix it.' they say, ‘we’ll fix it together!’ 
in america, we don't say, “i alone can fix it.” we say, "we'll fix it together.”
americans don’t say: “i alone can fix it.” we say: “ok, how are we going to fix this together?”
what trump really means when he says "make america great again”:
trump says he hires the best people. this is what he means:
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
what he did here in atlantic city is exactly what he’ll do if he wins in november.  on @realdonaldtrump :
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.
hillary at tonight’s  :
don’t let anyone tell you that great things can’t happen in america.
trump's wall on the border would likely cost at least $25 billion. some things we could do instead:

there's only one candidate in this race with more votes than donald trump.
after becoming the first woman to win the sc primary, hillary spoke to a packed house. here's what she had to say:
"she has so much compassion and it shows. she's a person, she's a grandmother, she's somebody's mother."
so far we’ve received nearly 9 million votes—more than a million more than donald trump and 2.5 million more than senator sanders.
shirley was born before women had the right to vote. she's seen a lot—and now she wants to see a woman president.

we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
donald trump says he wants to make america great again—well, he could start by actually making things in america again. 
it's time the entire country stood up against the nra.
discrimination against lgbt people is all too common—and goes against everything we stand for as a country.

there’s no place for second-class status in the united states of america.

if you're with hillary, now is the time to stand up and say so. if you can, pitch in to show her you’re with her:
donald trump’s not just wrong about judge curiele’s wrong about america. he’s wrong about what makes this country great.
at the 2016 dnc, @hrc press secretary @sarahemcbride became the first openly trans person to speak at a convention.
“even if people don’t vote for me in november, i’m going to be for them and for you every single day.”
thank you, @berniesanders . thank you for your leadership and your support in this campaign.

"she cares. she tries. she perseveres." @jonfavs on supporting hillary in 2016:
we’ve got to step up as a country and deal with this. the time to take action against the zika virus is right now.
the worst part is, trump's disturbing policies for immigrant families go way beyond just "building a wall."
think beyond candy and flowers. this mother's day, get mom a call from hillary:
no one should face discrimination for who they are or who they love—i support efforts for equality in houston & beyond.   
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
what's wrong with this picture?
donald trump’s not just wrong about judge curiele’s wrong about america. he’s wrong about what makes this country great.
this isn't who we are, and it also isn't how we keep america safe.
if you're looking for someone to say what is wrong with america, i'm not your candidate. i think there is more right than wrong. 
donald trump isn’t who we are. we’re better than this.
we are americans. we will not turn on each other or our principles. that's how we win.
instead of shouting about what's wrong with america, let's make it work for everyone.
if you want a president who will listen to you, work her heart out to make your life better—then you’re lookin’ at her.
to everyone who's worked so hard, thank you. let's go win this thing.

environmental justice isn't just a public health issue—it's a civil rights issue.
enough with the bigotry and bombast. donald trump's not offering real change, he’s offering empty promises. 
no, barack obama is not the founder of isis.
hillary on equal pay: "this is not a women’s issue. this is a family issue. this is an american economic issue."
we need a president who can take on republicans and get the job done.
hillary is on @meetthepress this morning, check your local listings and tune in.
when we talk about the outrage happening in flint, it's important to talk about who lives there.
so great to see @billclinton taking  on the road to india to talk about women in the economy.
headed in from chappaqua on this snowy morning to talk to @melindagates about why data is so important for women and girls.
when we talk about criminal justice reform, we also have to talk about jobs, education, and housing.
a key difference between the two candidates at the  last night:
together, we won't just make promises we can't keep—we'll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people of america. 
i am a progressive who likes to make progress. i don't make promises i can't keep. 
i'm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and i'm not making promises that i cannot keep.  at
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
i want every young person in america to know that if you work hard, you can get ahead, and i want america to have your back. in nh
there's no better word for this than the one hillary just used: "outrage."
i want to get comprehensive immigration reform. and i want to start trying to get it as soon as i'm elected, if i'm so fortunate. 
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
i will bring law enforcement and communities together to develop national guidelines on the use of force by police officers. 
"perhaps the best way to honor our police is to follow the lead of police departments across the country who are striving to do better."
"we need to fix the crisis of mass incarceration...and end the epidemic of african americans being killed by police or dying in custody."
there is clear evidence that black americans are more likely to be killed in police incidents than any other group. we have to do better.
killing police officers is a terrible crime...anyone who kills a police officer and anyone who helps must be held accountable. 
america has always been a country of "we," not "me." and we've always been stronger together.

from the bottom of my heart: thank you, iowa. 
5 days to iowa!

statement on the passing of supreme court justice antonin scalia:
. @potus is doing his job by nominating a new supreme court justice. tell senate republicans to do theirs:
we are not going to privatize the ., we’re going to reform it. 
donald trump says, and this is a quote, 'i know more about isis than the generals do.' no, donald, you don't. 
the american auto industry just had its best year ever. so yes, we can bring american manufacturing back.
also saved by that vote: millions of jobs, the economy, and the auto industry.   status/720783551294267393 …
the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill. senator sanders voted against it.

hillary at tonight’s  :
president obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done. 
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
america has always been about working together to get things done.
this shouldn't have to be said: you don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. it doesn’t work. no one buys it.
. @jebbush fixed it for you.
here you go, @jebbush :
hbcus provide more than a quality education—they increase opportunity. supporting them is critical.
we can step up and confront climate change, save our planet, and invest in clean energy. or, we can do nothing.

what donald trump did in atlantic city is nothing to brag about—it’s shameful—and every voter in america needs to know about it.
whatever language you speak, you should feel welcome in america.
quarterly capitalism—focusing only on short-term profits—is bad for wages, bad for business, and bad for our economy.
if donald trump doesn't show all americans the respect they deserve, he doesn't deserve to be their president.
“even if people don’t vote for me in november, i’m going to be for them and for you every single day.”
he doesn’t speak for immigrants...i don’t think he speaks for women. i don’t think he speaks for working families.  on trump

join hillary's fight to build an america where we don't leave anyone out or anyone behind:
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
we have a chance to build on the progress we've made and to get results for people...that's my goal. 
tea and good company for  . thanks, @mayoredlee ! 
want to do more to support  ? you're in luck:
this is big. we just won florida!
we're watching the party of lincoln become the party of trump. that's not just a loss for our country—it's a threat.
62 reasons why donald trump should never become president (from members of his own party).
what trump just did is a disgrace.
it's a disgrace that the government is making money off of lending to college students. we need to end that.
america needs leadership in the white house, not a liability.
we need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad. leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology. 
america needs strong, smart, steady leadership. the last thing we need are leaders who incite more fear.
hillary will fight to make it easier to vote—not harder.
big win for those who think we should make it easier, not harder, to vote (which really should be all of us).  
we need to make it easier to balance work and family.
let's make it easier to raise a family in america.
we need to make it easier for women to get ahead at work while still being there for their families.
yeah, @berniesanders —she's got a *bit* of experience.

it's not brain surgery: republicans tend to be a bit more truth-y when the presidency isn't on the line.
statement of hillary clinton on the shooting of laquan mcdonald:
. @johnkasich is right on one thing: the budget was balanced under president bill clinton.
hillary clinton’s statement on her comments about the reagans' record on hiv and aids:
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
what happened in flint would never have happened in a wealthy, white suburb of detroit. 
watch what happened when our youngest volunteer got to work at campaign hq.
what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.
we cannot demonize, demagogue, and declare war on an entire religion...hate is not the answer to hate. 
what happened in north carolina is the latest reminder that the fight for lgbt equality is far from over.
"we can raise incomes if we start paying women the equal pay we deserve for our work."

if we claim we are for families, then we have to fix our immigration system. we can’t wait any longer for a path to full, equal citizenship.
paying for college doesn't end at tuition, so we need to help students pay for other costs like books and housing.
we'll reward companies that share profits with employees and pay a good wage. if they can do it for executives, they can do it for workers.

new york is a place for dreaming big. but new yorkers also like to get things done. 
hillary in new york yesterday:
happy fourth of july!
"every day, more americans are standing up and saying 'enough is enough'—including a lot of republicans. i’m honored to have their support."
trump's plan wouldn't just cut taxes for rich people—it would raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
trump's plan: cut taxes for billionaires & millionaires like him. raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
we're not going to raise incomes for middle-class families by raising their taxes.
8 ways we can give middle-class families a raise, not one of which is cutting taxes for billionaires.
hillary is the only candidate on stage who has pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class.
when you run for president of the united states, the entire world is watching.  on @realdonaldtrump 's dangerous rhetoric
i accept your nomination for president of the united states! 
trump's attacks on women's health are just as bad as the rest of the gop candidates'.
the united states is the only country in the developed world without guaranteed paid leave. that has to change.
donald trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states.
donald trump has no actual plan to create jobs.
“as of tomorrow, we have 100 days to make our case to america. so what better place to kick off this campaign than where it all started?"
hillary's new college plan will help more students, especially students of color, afford college:
no one should be in debt to a college that defrauded them—forgiving students is the right decision. thx, @usedgov .  
chelsea, thank you. i am so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you’ve become. 
america has always been a country of "we," not "me." and we've always been stronger together.
“i have seen many incredible things...i look forward to seeing a woman president."

the best mother's day gift has been seeing my daughter become a mom. happy mother's day to @chelseaclinton —and to every mom and grandma! –h
flint wasn't just treated with indifference, it was treated with neglect, and that isn't acceptable.
we are better than this.
every person in this country deserves to be treated with respect. 
on  , we remember that our work isn’t done until everyone can be who they are and is treated with dignity.
our veterans and military families deserve better.
to every survivor of sexual assault...you have the right to be heard. you have the right to be believed. we're with you. 
president obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done. 
if the young women of this country have donald trump as their president, what will they think of themselves?
we have an obligation to protect an open internet and defend net neutrality:
we have an obligation not just to our own children and grandchildren, but to every child in america.
people are angry. and they have every right to be. but i know they’re also hungry. they’re hungry for solutions. 
no, they’re not talking about the gop debate. catch hillary on @jimmyfallon next!
do all the good we can, in all the ways we can, in all the places we can, for all the people we can.  2-48ed-85c7-3f1e5b81efc4 …
as we methodists like to say: do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can. 
if you could tell hillary why you're on her team, what would you say?
"president trump" would undo so much of the progress we’ve made over the past 8 years under president obama. we can't let that happen.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
america is stronger because of president obama's leadership, and i am better because of his friendship. 
reason 3 of many why hillary should be our next president.
missing jon stewart already.   
jon stewart returned to @thedailyshow to stand up for a cause that a lot of new yorkers—and americans—care about:
why would we give trump's family a $4 billion tax cut when we could use that money to fix 8,000 bridges?

hillary wants to change how we think about business.
i will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. 
americans need a raise.
here's how we're celebrating  .
we need to protect and build on the affordable care act, not start over with another contentious national debate.
health care should be a human right. we should build on the affordable care act—not start over.

it matters what we do, not just what we say. it didn’t matter what we called bin laden—it mattered that we got bin laden.

hillary "knows that it is absurd that middle-class americans are paying an effective tax rate higher than hedge fund millionaires.” —bernie
trump's plan wouldn't just cut taxes for rich people—it would raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
trump's plan: cut taxes for billionaires & millionaires like him. raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
we're not going to raise incomes for middle-class families by raising their taxes.
hillary is the only candidate on stage who has pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class.
young people face tough challenges, but they have the ability to do something about it: vote.

what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
any candidate seriously competing to be president should seriously campaign everywhere. that’s what we’ve done.
donald trump is an expert at distracting people from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.
"it's about time this country had somebody running it who has an idea about money." —trump
"she has so much compassion and it shows. she's a person, she's a grandmother, she's somebody's mother."
if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
even @speakerryan called trump’s comments on judge curiel, “the textbook definition of a racist comment.”
we need leaders...who put the interests of the american people ahead of their personal business interests.  at
hillary is fighting for all of us.

trump has banished members of the press who have criticized him. is there any doubt he would do the same as president?
america is stronger because of president obama's leadership, and i am better because of his friendship. 
donald trump could bankrupt america like he bankrupted his companies. let's make sure he never gets the chance:
right before the housing market crashed, @realdonaldtrump said he hoped it would happen—because he could make money off of it.
trump is right about one thing.
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.
i think the president's job is to do everything possible—everything she can do—to lift up the people of this country. 
what was your favorite part of hillary's official launch speech? annotate it using @genius :
had enough? do something about it:
mayor of flint: “this isn't something that's going to go away.”
this isn't who we are, and it also isn't how we keep america safe.
being a champion for everyday americans isn't just about talking—it's also about listening.
i believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should. 
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.

when you have a really, really good night.
neighbors talking to neighbors = politics the way it should be.
there is no other donald trump. this is it.
donald trump is not who we are.
“one of the merits is i am a woman.”
we have a chance to build on the progress we've made and to get results for people...that's my goal. 
what’s the best way to stand up for voting rights? get registered:
the results are in: we won north carolina!
hillary wants to be the small-business president. here's what that means:
the best way i can sum up what i hope this election will lead to...is: love trumps hate. 
some good advice from hillary.
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
i know how hard this job is. you need steadiness as well as strength and smarts... donald trump is not qualified.  on @cnn
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
"she has so much compassion and it shows. she's a person, she's a grandmother, she's somebody's mother."
“she gained about 55 pounds in...9 months. she was like an eating machine.” —trump, a man who wants to be president:
. @realdonaldtrump : “i’m the last person she wants to run against."
“as president, she won’t just say she’s going to do something. she will follow through and actually do it.”
under trump, our economy would lose 3.5 million jobs. hillary's plan would create 10.4 million—in one term alone.
thank you, @hrc .
. @hrc you have fought with persistence and great courage for lgbt equality. from one hrc to another—i’m proud to have your support. 
with the money trump would waste on his wall, we could help a lot of families by building infrastructure we need.
tearing up the iran nuclear deal isn't leadership—it's recklessness.

donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. 
the  is offering a stark picture of one vision for america. here's another:
you have a problem when a candidate looks to saddam hussein and kim jong-un as examples of good leadership.
when we work together, we will trump hate.
donald trump's praise for brutal dictators like saddam hussein knows no bounds.
we are better than this.
unity is better than division, empowerment is better than resentment, and bridges are better than walls.
i believe with all my heart that america is better than this. america is better than donald trump. 
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
he sure doesn’t speak for me, because i know we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re going to be.  on trump

there's no better word for this than the one hillary just used: "outrage."
she told me that he was a great runner! i just thought, "how would this happen?" i knew it should happen, but i also knew the challenges.
you know hillary's a candidate—but did you know she's also a  winner? more things you never knew about her:
to all of your supporters here and around the country: i want you to know, i've heard you.  on @berniesanders

"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
to be be great, we can’t be small. we can’t lose what made america great in the first place.
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
to be great, we can't be small. we have to be as big as the values that define america. 
"i will be a president for democrats, republicans, and independents. for the struggling, the striving and the successful…for all americans."

if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
donald trump's business strategy: it's not about what you can build. it's about how much you can take.
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.

a republican president would undo @potus ’ progress on climate, guns, immigration, and a whole lot more.
as president hillary will stand up for kids and families. she’s done it her whole life:

this threat is real, but so is our resolve. americans will not cower. we will prevail. 
it’s not a coincidence that the flint water crisis was allowed to happen in a largely black, largely poor community.
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
no wonder donald trump is hiding his tax returns.
does trump actually pay his fair share in taxes? until he releases his tax returns, voters won't know for sure.

did hillary rock at  ?
america needs strong, smart, steady leadership. the last thing we need are leaders who incite more fear.
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
trump is right about one thing.
what the world needs now is love.
"it's about time this country had somebody running it who has an idea about money." —trump

it's not just history that's watching us—it's the future, too.
it's not just a value—it's a real plan.
donald trump wants to spend $3 trillion (yes, with a t) on tax cuts for people like him.
what you're really hearing at the  : more tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, no real plans for the middle class.
. @realdonaldtrump ’s tax cuts for millionaires & billionaires would add more than $30 trillion to our national debt.
it's wrong that millionaires get more tax cuts while families are facing barriers to success. this election is a chance to make it right.
trump would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and wall street money managers.
so how exactly did donald trump build his own bank account? on the backs of american taxpayers:
so, how did donald trump's first swing at diplomacy go? not so great. try to follow his decision-making process:
young people face tough challenges, but they have the ability to do something about it: vote.
keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority. 
we have to face the hard truths about race in america.
donald trump’s campaign adds up to an ugly, dangerous message to america. a message that you should be afraid. 
a message from hillary to young women everywhere:
let's send donald trump—and the world—a clear message.
let's send donald trump a message in november: we're not going back.
send hillary a message of support as she heads into the  :

what trump really means when he says "make america great again”:

at this point, donald trump has insulted the vast majority of americans. the good news is, there's something we can all do about it: vote.
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
donald trump & ted cruz are pushing a vision for america that's divisive & dangerous. we should be lifting people up—not tearing them down.
donald trump’s tax plan would give $3.2 trillion to millionaires & billionaires. ted cruz would give them even more. we can't afford that.
when republican candidates like ted cruz call for treating american muslims like criminals, it’s not just wrong—it’s counter-productive.

trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
donald trump says he wants to make america great again—well, he could start by actually making things in america again.

we cannot go back to the failed policies of the past. we will not go back. america's best days are still ahead.
we will have legislation to enact comprehensive immigration reform before congress within my first 100 days in office.
hillary will fight to make it easier to vote—not harder.
we need comprehensive immigration reform now. i'll propose legislation within my first 100 days as president. 
immigration is good for america. immigration built our country.  at @ushcc

5 times hillary clinton nailed it on the  stage—and what to expect from her tonight.
let’s make sure our future is in the right hands.
hillary wants to change how we think about business.
when you short-change women, you short-change families and you short-change america.  on why she's fighting for equal pay
making the wrong choice on climate change would be a disaster for our kids and grandkids.
matt, on the left in that photo, is our talented senior designere's been with us since he was a student intern!
two weeks to iowa!
how could hillary and president obama work together after a tough campaign? simple.
barack obama is president of the united states until january 20, 2017—that is a fact, whether the republicans like it or not. 
no one can get this done alone—not even the president of the united states. it’s got to be the mission of our entire nation.
the united states is the only country in the developed world without guaranteed paid leave. that has to change.
donald trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states.
when you run for president of the united states, the entire world is watching.  on @realdonaldtrump 's dangerous rhetoric
chelsea, thank you. i am so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you’ve become.

this is big. we just won florida!
the results are in: we won north carolina!
meet @timkaine 's running mate and the next vice president of the united states.
mike pence would outlaw abortion. and donald trump just made him his running mate.
if you thought donald trump was going to pick a running mate who would appeal to moderates, think again.
i'm thrilled to announce my running mate, @timkaine , a man who's devoted his life to fighting for others. 
that time donald trump introduced his running mate...sort of.  4-4b09-a4a0-f267307f8370 …
good morning, new hampshire! see you at the polls.
what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
watch live now: hillary speaks on the iran deal →
hillary: “i’m excited to be here and i'm really excited about starting a campaign by talking to the people who really have a stake in it.”
america has always been a country of "we," not "me." and we've always been stronger together.
i’ve been called a lot of things over the years, but ‘unqualified’ has not been one of them. 
@billclinton it's a date!
to everyone who's ever been bullied for being who you are: you're perfect, and i'm proud of you.  
if you have to miss school, make sure you have a note.
if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
as your president, i will always have your back. 
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
how much more money would you have if you didn’t have student loan debt?
this is one of the biggest days of the entire campaign. chip in $1 right now, and let’s win this primary together.
this is just common sense. it's time for congress to act.
profit sharing is just common sense. see hillary's plan:
we’ve got to step up as a country and deal with this. the time to take action against the zika virus is right now.
we made history tonight—but we have more work to do. chip in if you've got hillary's back:
we've got to do everything we possibly can not to let the republicans rip away our progress and take us backwards. 
we’ve got to get back to a place where people listen to and respect one another.
if you're with hillary, now's the time to show it. chip in before tonight's debate to have her back:
"because of you, this campaign is the only one—democrat or republican—to win 10 million votes.”
psst: there's only one candidate—on either side—who's prepared to be commander in chief.
our elections should be shaped by voters' voices—not bought and sold by corporations & special interests :
there is one candidate, in either party, who's prepared to keep us safe as commander in chief. she's on stage at the  right now.
the "winners" from last night's  :
in case you missed it last night
@potus nice job last night. aunt hillary approves.  
thank you, @potus .
thank you for loving all people, especially 'the least, the last, and the lost' among us.  to the @nbcusa_inc
if you think hillary is the best person to be president, chip in $1:
remember: if he becomes president, donald trump would have the . economy in his hands.
if you were president, how would you spend $4 billion? (one guess as to trump's answer:  )
12. how can we be sure you'd be willing to be tough on any nation if necessary, if it would put your interests and profits at risk?
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
reason 3 of many why hillary should be our next president.
next january, our next president will be sworn in. add your name if you think it should be hillary:
our next president has to bring our country together. we should be breaking down barriers, not building walls.
112 reasons (and counting) why hillary should be our next president:
he doesn’t speak for immigrants...i don’t think he speaks for women. i don’t think he speaks for working families.  on trump
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
you don’t make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great.  on donald trump
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
to every little girl who dreams big: yes, you can be anything you want—even president. tonight is for you. 
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
"if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. and when you get ahead, america gets ahead."
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
donald trump is not who we are.
i know how hard this job is. you need steadiness as well as strength and smarts... donald trump is not qualified.  on @cnn
as of tonight, only one thing is standing between donald trump and the presidency: all of us. get your free sticker:
trump is right about one thing.
thank you, @berniesanders . thank you for your leadership and your support in this campaign. 
good morning, new hampshire! see you at the polls.
when you have a really, really good night.
. @davidaxelrod , former senior advisor to president obama, on hillary’s greatest accomplishments.
trump's dangerously wrong when he says “i alone can fix it.” americans haver never put our faith in one man—we put our faith in each other.
we cannot afford to have a republican succeed barack obama as president of the united states.

i intend to close my campaign the way i began my career: fighting for kids and families..it will be the passion of my presidency. 
it's time to finally put access to care for mental health on par with physical health.
if you're looking for someone to say what is wrong with america, i'm not your candidate. i think there is more right than wrong. 
any candidate seriously competing to be president should seriously campaign everywhere. that’s what we’ve done.
"it's fair to say the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top. there's something wrong with that."
trump: "i love war, in a certain way."
lincoln: "war, at its best, is terrible." trump: "i love war." how trump's words compare to former presidents':
economists project that trump’s plans would add more than $5,000,000,000,000 to the national debt. that's "trillion" with a "t."
4,000,000 followers. wow! thanks for joining us—  wouldn’t be the same without you.

this race comes down to two things: what kind of future we want for our kids and how we achieve it.
texts from hillary,  edition.
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
when we talk about the outrage happening in flint, it's important to talk about who lives there.
it is not enough to be on the money. you need to be making the money.  on ensuring equal pay for women
we are going to end the federal government making money off of lending money to get your education.
3) an important part of being a progressive is making progress. from health care to fighting inequality, hillary's record speaks for itself.
agreed, president @billclinton !

what would our country look like under a republican president? here’s a glimpse.

in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
when you work hard, you should not be living in poverty.
new yorkers have always believed that if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.

judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is.

southern democratic voters matter just as much as every other democratic voter.

it's easy to say you'll fix wall street—it's harder to actually do it. hillary has a plan to get it done.
"to create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more americans."
donald trump has no actual plan to create jobs.
"my primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the united states."
tim has spent most of his life in public service because he believes in doing everything he can to make a difference in people’s lives.

donald trump & ted cruz are pushing a vision for america that's divisive & dangerous. we should be lifting people up—not tearing them down.
we should be helping more immigrant families stay together, not tearing them apart.
we know donald trump is not who we are. if you want to shut him down, then let’s vote him down.
72 years after  , let's not just eulogize the brave men who gave their lives. let's honor them by defending the values they fought for.

we need a president who can do all aspects of the job...i'm ready to take it on. 
these things can be true at once: we need criminal justice reform. we need to support police. we need to do more to stop gun violence.
we need a president who sees the best in all of us.
we don't just need to pray...we need to act...republicans and the nra say, now is not the time to talk about guns. yes, it is. 
we need more love and kindness in this country...the last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are.

what would our country look like under a republican president? here’s a glimpse.
under trump, our economy would lose 3.5 million jobs. hillary's plan would create 10.4 million—in one term alone.
i mourn for the officers shot while doing their sacred duty to protect peaceful protesters, for their families & all who serve with them. 
a president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country. 
america can’t wait. families need their next president to roll up her sleeves and make a difference in their lives right now.
every time trump makes a show of railing against outsourcing, remember the countries he shipped jobs and profits to:  d-4ce6-a5ce-4cace2f66deb …
this has gone on too long, and it's time that the entire country stood up against the nra.  on gun violence
right now, too many americans are being held back by student debt. we’ve got to fix that:
we don’t want to turn against each other. we want to work with one another. we want to set big goals in this country.
all of the other issues we want to deal with depend on our country being secure and strong. 
trump: "i love war, in a certain way."
now we know what trump really thinks about us. sad!
economists project that trump’s plans would add more than $5,000,000,000,000 to the national debt. that's "trillion" with a "t."
i'm told the number just ticked over: as of a few minutes ago, 1,000,000 people have pitched in to be a part of this campaign. thank you. 
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.

"if the medicine you need costs less in canada, you should be able to buy it from canada—or any country that meets our safety standards."
just yesterday, trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the united states.
need another reason to be upset with republican candidates? as you wish:
the truth is, we aren’t a single-issue country. we need more than a plan for the big banks. the middle class needs a raise.
if we claim we are for families, then we have to fix our immigration system. we can’t wait any longer for a path to full, equal citizenship.
if we aren't doing everything we can to prevent  , then we're not doing nearly enough.
we had a big night on super tuesday. now, we have to keep fighting even harder. when we stand together, there's nothing we can't do.

who benefits from donald trump's tax plan? billionaires like donald trump.
what he did here in atlantic city is exactly what he’ll do if he wins in november.  on @realdonaldtrump :
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.

there are six republicans left in the race for the white house—and we can’t afford to let any of them near it.

you shouldn't have to worry about your paycheck or your job when you have a baby or someone in your family gets sick.

newly discovered footage that could destroy donald trump’s campaign if everyone saw it:
i won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign. 
before hillary takes the  stage, check out her record of results:
it’s not the big banks that need relief from washington—it’s small banks and small businesses.
we already have dodd-frank. we need to go further to tackle dangerous risks in the big banks—and outside the big banks.
the truth is, we aren’t a single-issue country. we need more than a plan for the big banks. the middle class needs a raise.
it's not enough to only crack down on big banks. we need to go further and tackle other dangerous risks.
democrats agree we need to hold big banks accountable—but hillary's the only candidate who never voted to reduce oversight on wall street.
the force is strong with this one.

what is trump spending his meager campaign resources on? why, himself, of course.  atus/745082013321990145 …
trump's statements are lies—but he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.

trump the businessman? a total failure. he bankrupted his atlantic city casinos (but pocketed millions for himself):
trump boasts the support of some of the most extreme voices in politics. now one of them runs his campaign:

"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
"we truly are stronger together — and together, we’re going to make history." a note from hillary:
"that bargain has eroded. our job is to make it strong again."
we must renew the basic bargain of america: if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.
the labor movement pioneered the basic bargain that made america great: if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead.
hillary and dr. glenda glover of @tsuedu : hbcus are fundamental to the basic bargain of america.
donald trump's foreign policy isn't just offensive, it's dangerous.
there’s no doubt about it—donald trump is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the united states.
"the united states needs to lead in the americas. and if we don't, make no mistake—others will."
there’s no place for second-class status in the united states of america.
“if there’s another child out there that can be saved, i will do this for the rest of my life.” -gwen carr
"i have no doubt we can meet this challenge — if we meet it together." hillary's address on the orlando attack:
this shouldn't have to be said: you don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. it doesn’t work. no one buys it.
"i’ll be the first to admit...i’ve made my own mistakes; i've walked my own journey. but i believe with all my heart that we can do better."
6. given that you've already questioned our commitments to nato allies, what is your answer to this?
9. have you or your campaign discussed .-russian relations with the russian billionaires with whom you've done business?
to all of your supporters here and around the country: i want you to know, i've heard you.  on @berniesanders
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
in case you missed it last night
the "winners" from last night's  :
. @potus is confirming what we know: our economy—and our country—are stronger under a democratic president.
when there’s a democrat in the white house, america creates more jobs, the economy grows faster, and deficits are smaller. 
make history and help shatter one of the highest glass ceilings. apply to be a hillary for america intern today:
the american people expect us to lead. to learn the right lessons. to rise above partisanship and reach for statesmanship. 
5 times hillary clinton nailed it on the  stage—and what to expect from her tonight.
happy  ! here's to teachers who educate and inspire, in and out of the classroom.
when it was time to fund the rescue of our auto industry, only one democratic candidate voted yes.
this is the only comprehensive plan from a presidential candidate to support families with autism:
only reaction to  ? bring it on.
trump isn’t the only candidate missing from the  stage tonight. so is anyone who would protect daca and dapa.
the american auto industry just had its best year ever. so yes, we can bring american manufacturing back.
happy first day of summer.
a day to remember.
happy father's day, @billclinton ! doesn't this feel like yesterday? 
"i would give every single day that i have left for just one more day with my mom." —erica smegielski
first stop on new york primary day.
comprehensive background checks would ensure those who can responsibly own guns do—and those who can’t, don't.
this  , we honor those who sacrificed for equality & fought for justice, and we recognize those who carry on the legacy. 
big win for those who think we should make it easier, not harder, to vote (which really should be all of us).  
we pray for those families and for the souls of all those we lost this week and all those preceding. may they rest in god’s peace 
if the candidates who deny climate change aren't scientists, why don't they start listening to those who are?
"it’s true: i sweat the details of policy...because it’s not just a detail if it’s your kid, if it’s your family. it’s a big deal."
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
hillary on the flint water crisis: "would it have happened if they were rich and white instead of poor and black?"
if you see bigotry, you should oppose it. if you see violence, you should condemn it. if you see a bully, you should stand up to him.
if you dream it, you should be able to build it.
we don’t want to turn against each other. we want to work with one another. we want to set big goals in this country.
we are americans. we will not turn on each other or our principles. that's how we win.
as @flotus said, this election is about what kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations.
we can criticize and protest mr. trump all we want...but none of that matters if we don’t also show up at the polls.  in oh
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc

donald trump’s campaign of prejudice and paranoia is unlike anything we’ve seen—and it’s profoundly dangerous.
donald trump says, and this is a quote, 'i know more about isis than the generals do.' no, donald, you don't. 
are you with hillary? let her know:
it’s  and thousands are heading to the polls. rt to let them know why you're with her!
"i want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving, and the successful."
we have to stand together and be proud together. there is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate.
"i will be a president for democrats, republicans, and independents. for the struggling, the striving and the successful…for all americans."
what trump just did is a disgrace.
did hillary rock at  ?
a woman told hillary she was fired after losing her baby: "what happened to you was not only wrong—it's illegal."  0-4871-bf55-8a4817efdbd3 …
we did it, new york! watch hillary live:
president obama’s job was to save us from a second great depression—and that’s exactly what he did. 
we have to end the era of mass incarceration. 
thank you, president carter.
come on oakland, let's do this - a great rallying cry from @urbanstratoak on why talking, reading, & singing matters.
we believe that everyone has value. we believe that everyone's created equal. we believe that love trumps hate.
"you have made me a better person and helped me believe i can do anything."

they may not have donald’s pizzazz, but the rest of the gop candidates are singing his tune:  c-49bb-b2e8-1134ca08c4ab …
donald trump’s not just wrong about judge curiele’s wrong about america. he’s wrong about what makes this country great.
if you're looking for someone to say what is wrong with america, i'm not your candidate. i think there is more right than wrong.

in america, we don’t begrudge people being successful…but we do if they get rich by destroying other people. 
young people face tough challenges, but they have the ability to do something about it: vote.
marriage equality is the law of the land. officials don't have to agree—but they do have to uphold the law.
trump's extreme immigration speech got rave reviews—from white supremacists, the alt-right, and ann coulter.
hillary believes that what’s good for women is good for america.
the good news is that my pneumonia finally got some republicans interested in women’s health. 
we are a nation of second chances, especially for young people. good news from scotus today.  
trump has banished members of the press who have criticized him. is there any doubt he would do the same as president?
we made history tonight—but we have more work to do. chip in if you've got hillary's back:
the american auto industry just had its best year ever. so yes, we can bring american manufacturing back.
we are better than this.
we’re better than that.
we're better than this.
we’re better than this.
if you believe that every man, woman & child in america has the right to affordable health care, join us! 
let’s make sure our future is in the right hands.

this from a man who says he’s “sacrificed” for our country.  us/760497858344734721 …
we need a leader who will bring us together—not drive us apart.
the united states is the only country in the developed world without guaranteed paid leave. that has to change.

the president has to strengthen the economy, fight for families, and keep the country safe. that's the job.
there are more mass shootings in the united states than any other country in the world...we cannot accept this. not now—not ever.

what's wrong with this picture?
this is what a comprehensive (not "secret") counterterrorism plan looks like.

this is what real leadership looks like.  tus/745638278406242304 …
as @potus spoke powerfully on protecting kids from gun violence, @realdonaldtrump said end gun free school zones. we deserve better. 
getting rid of gun-free school zones. banning muslims entering the country. what you need to know about trump:
yes—black lives matter.  at
the next president has to be able to stand up to republicans and stop their backward agenda.
as dr. king said, 'our lives begin to end when we become silent about things that matter.' none of can afford to be silent. 
"the third key driver of income gains alongside strong growth and fair growth must be long-term growth."
"to create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more americans."
"today i am proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hard-working americans. an agenda for strong growth, fair growth, & long-term growth."
michigan proves every day that american workers are the best in the world—all they need is a fair chance on a fair playing field. 
"when all americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our country’s prosperity—that’s fair growth."
getting ready to make some history.

we need a president who can do all aspects of the job...i'm ready to take it on. 
are you ready for the first woman president?
imagine if this was our president.
we're never asked about [abortion]—this goes to who we are as women: our rights, autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions. 
donald trump is not qualified to be president, and he is temperamentally unfit to be commander-in-chief.
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
do you think donald trump is qualified to be president? — @chriscuomo no, i do not.

here's an easy way to help hillary win in new hampshire—it only takes 5 minutes!
president trump? cruz? rubio? carson?
i’ve been called a lot of things over the years, but ‘unqualified’ has not been one of them. 
23 million americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get the treatment they need.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
if you see bigotry, you should oppose it. if you see violence, you should condemn it. if you see a bully, you should stand up to him.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
in america, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you.
why hillary fights to prevent gun violence: "you should be safe when you go to school, when you go to the movies, when you go to church."
as trump meets with president peña nieto, a helpful refresher on some of the things he’s said about mexico:
what would our country look like under a republican president? here’s a glimpse.
repeating the specific words 'radical islamic terrorism' is just a distraction...our priority should be how to fight the enemy. 
we will not ban a religion—we will work with all americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism. 
hillary on equal pay: "this is not a women’s issue. this is a family issue. this is an american economic issue."
the threats we face are real. the next president will take office in a year—and he or she needs a real plan to defeat terrorism.
unlike donald trump, i will not pander to the gun lobby. we will not be silenced and we will not be intimidated. 
getting ready to make some history.
(the "f" doesn't stand for "friends")
are you ready for the first woman president?
today’s the day! ready to stand with hillary? say  now:
the progress we’ve made under @potus is remarkable. hillary on how we can keep it going:
what was your favorite part of hillary's official launch speech? annotate it using @genius :
one year later (still one of our favorite maps).
the boys are right. we need everyone's help to get the planet moving in the right direction.
let's review the record.
you should never have to choose between your paycheck and taking care of your family.
let’s make sure our future is in the right hands.
anyone who wants to be president of this country should have a real plan to raise incomes, create jobs, and improve our economy.
donald trump has no actual plan to create jobs.
hillary wants to change how we think about business.
"to create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more americans."
some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs...i want it to be us. 
the first two months of the  campaign—in a gif!
four months from today, our next president will walk into the oval office. help make sure it's not donald trump:
it's unconscionable that flint residents' complaints were dismissed by their government for months. gov. snyder should be held accountable.
"what i heard in those early days has stuck with me." hillary on the first 10 months of the campaign:
today, we'll hear trump talk about our veterans. our new ad on what they've been hearing from trump for months:
thank you, @potus .
well done, ireland. 
we're watching the party of lincoln become the party of trump. that's not just a loss for our country—it's a threat.
the republican party is now the party of trump. here's what it stands for.  7-4936-87bb-9cedcffe7ca8 …
democrats, we are the party of working people. 
we heard the man from hope, bill clinton. and the man of hope, barack obama.

"i know more about isis than the generals do." —donald trump no, you don't.
hillary at tonight’s  :
when you have a really, really good night.
trump likes to say he only hires the "best people," but he’s had to fire so many campaign managers it’s like an episode of the apprentice.
in a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside-in and the inside-out.
trump "can run his campaign however he chooses...i’m going to keep talking about the stakes in this election.”

here's what we can't afford: a republican in the white house.

we need more love and kindness in this country...the last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are.

if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
when you work hard, you should not be living in poverty.
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.

the "winners" from last night's  :
@potus nice job last night. aunt hillary approves.  
in case you missed it last night
last night, trump chose to talk about his deep admiration and support for putin. maybe he did it with a smile.
when we work together, we will trump hate.
i will always stand by israel’s right to defend itself, as i always have. 
people accuse me of all kinds of things—you’ve probably seen that. but nobody ever accuses me of quitting. 
it matters what we do, not just what we say. it didn’t matter what we called bin laden—it mattered that we got bin laden. 
providing a “trump kids club” for your paying customers is not the same thing as providing real child care for your workers.
when our seals took out bin laden, they brought the terrorists' families to safety first. that's american honor.

we should build a path to citizenship, not a wall on the border.
“what i’ve laid out is a path forward that will keep us safer...and go after the terrorists to finally destroy them"
a four-year college should not be the only path to a middle-class life:
"we can’t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship."
we need to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and convicted stalkers.
we need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals.  on the fl attack
we don't just need to pray...we need to act...republicans and the nra say, now is not the time to talk about guns. yes, it is. 
i believe we americans are capable of protecting second amendment rights while making sure guns don’t fall into the wrong hands. 
we can't allow guns to fall into the hands of domestic abusers, violent criminals, and the seriously mentally ill.
let's be clear: nothing—including an audit—is preventing trump from releasing his tax returns.
many people are saying trump won't release his tax returns because he's hiding something. what do you think it is?
"you would think there is almost, like, something wrong." —donald trump on mitt romney failing to release his tax returns, 2012
does trump pay his fair share in taxes? as long as he keeps refusing to release his tax returns, voters won't know.

military action should be the last resort—not the first choice.

republicans just voted to repeal obamacare and defund planned parenthood. good thing we have a democratic president:
the affordable care act is working—and it's too important to repeal.
the house voting to defund planned parenthood is an attack on women's health—nothing more, nothing less. republicans should be ashamed.
republicans who want to repeal the aca should try telling that to the 18 million people who have health coverage because of it.
note to candidates who boast that they'd repeal obamacare: health care should be a right—not just a privilege for those who can afford it.

"we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country."
"and we need to fix the dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all…"

trump wants to eliminate the estate tax. it would save the trump family $4 billion, but it would do nothing for 99.8% of americans.
we need leaders...who put the interests of the american people ahead of their personal business interests.  at
we inevitably must accept a level of risk to protect our country and advance our interests and values. 
a president should do everything she can not just to protect reproductive rights, but to advance them.

president obama was born in the united states. he’s american. trump only has one reason for refusing to admit it.
donald trump still refuses to admit president obama was born in the united states.
barack obama was born in america, plain and simple. donald trump owes him and the american people an apology.

one candidate would stand up for workers and their families. the other? not so much.
this is it: the caucuses and primaries are almost here. if you're with hillary, say so:
the republican party platform is so hateful, you'd think donald trump wrote it himself.
tonight, @thedemocrats voted for the most progressive party platform ever. here are some highlights:
proud to stand for quality, affordable health care. proud to  .
when we talk about the outrage happening in flint, it's important to talk about who lives there.
this election isn’t about style or rhetoric; it’s about tackling the issues that american families face every day.
when we talk about criminal justice reform, we also have to talk about jobs, education, and housing.
on my way to @twitter ! tweet your questions to me with  & watch my conversation with @katies here:
the fact that trump's answer to a question about racial injustice is just "we need law and order" pretty much says it all.

we believe that everyone has value. we believe that everyone's created equal. we believe that love trumps hate.
what the world needs now is love.
not only does trump deny climate change, he's now denying that the drought in california is even happening. what?
what’s happening with the water in flint, michigan is an outrage.
happy national dog day!
americans are hungry for solutions. they don’t just want us to diagnose problems, they want us to solve them.

there are more mass shootings in the united states than any other country in the world...we cannot accept this. not now—not ever.

can't think of a better day than one with family, food, and the best gift of all: a new grandchild on the way! merry christmas. 
if mr. trump gets his way, it'll be like christmas in the kremlin. it will make america less safe and the world more dangerous.

my thoughts and prayers are with president carter and his family.

the only thing standing between donald trump and the oval office is all of us. 
the force is strong with this one.
when small businesses are strong, our economy is strong.
businesses need to start focusing more on long-term growth than short-term profits. hillary's ideas:
when we work together, we will trump hate.
instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers. we need to show that we really are all in this together.  in sc
we have to decide whether we’re going to work together so we can all rise together. 
the aca is on the line in this election. we won’t let it be repealed or start from scratch. we’ll expand until we hit universal coverage.

the house voting to defund planned parenthood is an attack on women's health—nothing more, nothing less. republicans should be ashamed.
this election is about keeping american families safe and strong. the ideas we're hearing from republicans won't do that.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
it’s a simple but powerful idea: we believe that we are stronger together. 
it's easy to say you'll fix wall street—it's harder to actually do it. hillary has a plan to get it done.
thank you to all the wonderful volunteers who are working so hard for our campaign. you’re knocking down barriers.  in wa
“i have this old-fashioned notion that if you’re running for president, you should say what you’re going to do.”
thanks to you, victory is in sight. pitch in $1, and let's go win this nomination:
new yorkers have always believed that if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. 
"if you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead—and when everybody does their part, america gets ahead too."
next january, our next president will be sworn in. add your name if you think it should be hillary:
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
we've got to do everything we possibly can not to let the republicans rip away our progress and take us backwards.

psst: there's only one candidate—on either side—who's prepared to be commander in chief.
trump's candidacy is built on his business "credibility." but his business record matches his character: his only concern is his own profit.
on the trail in new hampshire this week, @billclinton told one of his favorite stories about hillary:  5-4bca-8ac8-8bc2c6cc43e4 …
these headlines on trump's lies are from just one week of his campaign. imagine four years of his presidency.
lying about veterans, his business, and his own words—and that wasn't even the worst thing trump said this week.
the trump loophole would let millionaires cut their tax rates in half and do nothing for 99.8% of americans.

"trump says he would run our country like he has run his businesses. well, i’m from jersey...we see how he leads in atlantic city.” —booker
donald trump just hired the head of an extreme, right-wing "news" organization to run his campaign.
no family should have to spend more than 10% of its income on quality child care.
hillary has spent her career fighting for families:
hillary wants to fix our immigration system so we can keep families together.
donald trump should come out of the towers he names after himself and actually talk and listen to people.
donald trump said profiting off working families getting kicked out of their homes & losing their jobs would be a ‘good result.’

americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.
at the  , we agree we need universal health care. that’s why hillary’s been fighting for it for 20+ years.
hillary's been a fighter for lgbt equality for years—and she's just getting warmed up. read her fiercest quotes:

he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
trump's attacks on women's health are just as bad as the rest of the gop candidates'.
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
we pray for those families and for the souls of all those we lost this week and all those preceding. may they rest in god’s peace 
i want to be a president for all americans, not just for some americans; democrats, republicans, independents. 
if donald trump doesn’t respect all americans, how can he serve all americans?
we don't just need to pray...we need to act...republicans and the nra say, now is not the time to talk about guns. yes, it is. 
attacks on planned parenthood are attacks on women's health and rights. we can't let them take us backwards.

"there may be some new voices in the republican presidential choir, but they're all singing the same old song. a song called 'yesterday.'"
donald trump is not who we are.
to donald, women like alicia are only as valuable as his personal opinion about their looks.
trump's candidacy is built on his business "credibility." but his business record matches his character: his only concern is his own profit.
donald trump is proud of his recklessness—that’s his business. but when he’s running for president, it’s ours.

"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
we need to take a hard look at our laws and our attitudes. we need to embrace policies that promote justice for all people.
trump's attacks on women's health are just as bad as the rest of the gop candidates'.
with a mother in the oval office, we may finally catch up to the rest of the world on paid leave.

he’s always doing that.
paying for college shouldn’t be the hardest part of going to college:
this is why i do it and this is who i’m in it for—to make life better for children and families. 
remember: if he becomes president, donald trump would have the . economy in his hands.
we had a big night on super tuesday. now, we have to keep fighting even harder. when we stand together, there's nothing we can't do.
we are resilient, determined, and hard-working. there’s nothing america can’t do if we do it together.
we need more love and kindness in this country...the last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are. 
there’s nothing more important than protecting our kids. if we fail at that, it doesn’t matter what we get right.
he sure doesn’t speak for me, because i know we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re going to be.  on trump
as your president, i will always have your back. 
hillary has fought for women her whole life—and she's just getting started.
this country belongs to all of us—not just to those at the top. not just to people who look one way, worship one way, or even think one way.
donald trump may lie, but the tape doesn't.
donald trump told lie after lie last night because it's all he has to offer the american people.
what does it mean to be a small-business president? read this:
rt if you agree: we need to make investing in childcare a national priority—and give childcare workers the pay and respect they deserve.
in trump’s world, a “good result” means trump gets his and working families get hurt. we're better than that.
if we care about working families, we should make it easier to work and have a family.
we have to move our country and ourselves…toward a future that reflects the simple, timeless notion that all of us are equal.

unions helped build the middle class, so when republicans attack unions, they're attacking millions of americans.
enough is enough. it’s time we make quality child care affordable for all working families. 
had enough? do something about it:

anyone who believes americans aren't working hard enough hasn't met enough american workers.
"every day, more americans are standing up and saying 'enough is enough'—including a lot of republicans. i’m honored to have their support."

this is real—donald trump just accepted the @gop nomination. rt if you agree: we can't let him become president.
donald trump is the presumptive @gop nominee. chip in now if you agree we can't let him become president:
yesterday was a preview of what would happen under a republican president. every single gop candidate would defund planned parenthood. 
if any of the gop candidates were president today, planned parenthood would now be defunded & the aca repealed. we can't let that happen. 
can't think of a better day than one with family, food, and the best gift of all: a new grandchild on the way! merry christmas. 
beautiful day for a campaign launch:
if mr. trump gets his way, it'll be like christmas in the kremlin. it will make america less safe and the world more dangerous.

we have to defend our progress on access to health care. add your name if you agree:
if we claim we are for families, then we have to fix our immigration system. we can’t wait any longer for a path to full, equal citizenship.

trump's statements are lies—but he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.
trump suggested that ted cruz’s father was involved in the kennedy assassination. of course there’s absolutely no evidence of that.
"he preyed on...people who had fallen on hard times. he’s conned them, he’s defrauded them, and he’s ripped them off.” —warren on trump
it's middle-class families that need a raise—not millionaires and billionaires.
support small businesses today! they are the backbone of our economy and represent the best of american ingenuity. 
the truth is, we aren’t a single-issue country. we need more than a plan for the big banks. the middle class needs a raise.
we need to rein in risk on wall street, and make sure middle class american families never have to bail it out again.
a four-year college should not be the only path to a middle-class life:
they're voting. are you? make sure you're registered:
you’re the reason we’re here. you’re the reason we’re going to win this nomination and then win this election.  in nh
...and while we're at it...
we're not going back, @realdonaldtrump .
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
"what part of democracy are all these candidates afraid of?" read why hillary is fighting to protect voting rights.
republicans are systematically...trying to stop millions of american citizens from voting. what part of democracy are they afraid of?rc
yet another republican refuses to make it easier to vote. what part of democracy are they so afraid of?   status/663765677036208128 …
donald trump might have gone decades without paying taxes—but he’s not afraid of telling other people to pay theirs.
most people who are bullies grow out of it. donald trump hasn't.
mike pence introduced himself to america last night. here's what we learned—and what he forgot to mention:
in case you missed it last night
economists project that trump’s plans would add more than $5,000,000,000,000 to the national debt. that's "trillion" with a "t."
4,000,000 followers. wow! thanks for joining us—  wouldn’t be the same without you.
i'm told the number just ticked over: as of a few minutes ago, 1,000,000 people have pitched in to be a part of this campaign. thank you.

hillary on her vision for the country:
torture doesn't work. it's wrong. these dangerous words from republicans have no place in our country.  
i love this country. i’m proud of this country. i want to be a leader who brings people together. 
it's not enough for a president to stop bad things from happening...i think it's important to try to start good things.  in nh
everything we need to do in our country really starts with how we treat our children.  in nh. watch live:
some folks may have the luxury to hold out for “the perfect.” but a lot of americans are hurting right now and they can’t wait for that.
if we aren't doing everything we can to prevent  , then we're not doing nearly enough.
"and we need to protect our country from threats that we see and the ones that are on the horizon."
a lesson from hillary's mom: "life's not about what happens to you. it's about what you do with what happens to you—so get back out there."
"some days" we're pretty proud of.
this choice is pretty straightforward.
so what exactly is donald trump hiding from voters? pretty much everything.
rape is a crime—wherever it happens. 
if i’m president, the united states will not condone or practice torture anywhere in the world.  in ca
lots of love in south carolina.
donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. 
only one person on last night's stage is prepared to be commander-in-chief. make sure she gets the chance:

in a normal election, these 126 things would disqualify trump from becoming president:
126 things donald trump has said and done that should disqualify his candidacy:
go vote today, new york needs you. text where to 47246 to find your polling place.
live in indiana? go vote: hillary needs you. text where to 47246 to find your polling place.
not much time left to vote in the nh primary! hillary needs you: confirm your polling place here, then head over.
you can’t just talk someone into trusting you. you’ve got to earn it ... i believe what you say matters. 
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
if you could tell hillary why you're on her team, what would you say?
when we join together, we can’t be beat. say you’re on team  :
" @wired sees only one person running for president who can do the job: hillary clinton."
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
there's only one candidate on stage who will support working families.
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.

every day, donald trump proves that he’s not in this for the american people. he’s in it for himself. 
when trump visited detroit on monday he talked only of failure, poverty, and crime. he’s missing so much about what makes michigan great.
no wonder donald trump is hiding his tax returns.
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
many people are saying trump won't release his tax returns because he's hiding something. what do you think it is?

a day to remember.
presidents have to be ready to tackle any issue that comes to their desk.
a president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country. 
72 years after  , let's not just eulogize the brave men who gave their lives. let's honor them by defending the values they fought for.
. @realdonaldtrump should stop complimenting women and start respecting them.
i am here to honor the service of those four men...and the work their colleagues do every single day all over the world. 
women earn just $0.79 for every $1 men do. that's a problem for all of us.

in a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside-in and the inside-out.
we should treat the caretakers who serve 11 million americans with serious medical needs like the heroes they are.

"we need a supreme court who cares more about the right to vote of a person than the right to buy an election of a corporation."
we can’t let donald trump anywhere near the supreme court.
if anyone needed a reminder of how important it is to take back the senate & hold onto the white house—look at the supreme court. 
trump's candidacy is built on his business "credibility." but his business record matches his character: his only concern is his own profit.
donald trump may live in his own reality—but we've got his own words right here. check them out:
what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.
trump prioritizing his own gain over americans' well-being isn't new, but it is telling: the only person he'll fight for is himself.
lying about veterans, his business, and his own words—and that wasn't even the worst thing trump said this week.
. @theellenshow , see you at 30 rock this afternoon. pantsuit up!

hillary at tonight’s  :
not one living president has said they believe donald trump has what it takes to be commander-in-chief.
americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
president obama was born in the united states. he’s american. trump only has one reason for refusing to admit it.
every day, donald trump proves that he’s not in this for the american people. he’s in it for himself. 
if you're standing with hillary, let her know:
don’t let anyone tell you that our country is weak—we’re not. don’t let anyone tell you we don’t have what it takes—we do.
@billclinton it's a date!

i want every young person in america to know that if you work hard, you can get ahead, and i want america to have your back. in nh
we don’t want to turn against each other. we want to work with one another. we want to set big goals in this country.
this race comes down to two things: what kind of future we want for our kids and how we achieve it.
as your president, i will always have your back. 
you're too kind, @sencapito .

hillary heard you: college costs are too high in america. it's time to fix it.

tearing up the iran nuclear deal isn't leadership—it's recklessness.

trump finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of mexico about building a wall. 
the ideological bent of the supreme court has led our country in the wrong direction—stacking the deck in favor of the wealthy and powerful.

hillary has fought for women her whole life—and she's just getting started.
hillary's counting on you to get involved—sign up to be part of this campaign:
many people are saying trump won't release his tax returns because he's hiding something. what do you think it is?
we're watching the party of lincoln become the party of trump. that's not just a loss for our country—it's a threat.
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.
no mother should have to feel this loss.
donald trump is not who we are.
this campaign is about making sure there are no ceilings—no limits—on any of us. 
do you think donald trump is qualified to be president? — @chriscuomo no, i do not. 
people are angry. and they have every right to be. but i know they’re also hungry. they’re hungry for solutions. 
donald trump has proven over and over again that he's unfit to be our commander-in-chief.
we’ve come too far to let republicans take us back. the fight for women’s reproductive rights is far from over.
a message from hillary to young women everywhere:
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.

i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
good morning, new hampshire! see you at the polls.
a day to remember.
"i would give every single day that i have left for just one more day with my mom." —erica smegielski
every day, donald trump proves that he’s not in this for the american people. he’s in it for himself. 
"we lost our mother a few years ago but i miss her every day. and i still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right"
“even if people don’t vote for me in november, i’m going to be for them and for you every single day.”

when you work hard, you should not be living in poverty.

good for you, jensen. every woman deserves equal pay, no matter what her age. keep up the hard work—and courage!

chelsea, thank you. i am so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you’ve become. 
happening now: watch hillary speak at the @ufcw conference in las vegas →
getting ready to make some history.
i believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should. 
big win for those who think we should make it easier, not harder, to vote (which really should be all of us).  
we have to face the world as it is but commit ourselves to turning it into what it should be. 
a day to remember.
i accept your nomination for president of the united states! 
for the first time in our history, a woman will be a major party’s nominee for president of the united states.
this should go without saying: taking nuclear war lightly is disqualifying for anyone seeking to be president of the united states.
donald trump might have gone decades without paying taxes—but he’s not afraid of telling other people to pay theirs.
donald trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states.
the academy has to catch up with our reality.  on the oscars’ diversity problem:
hillary has only received one f in her life and she's proud of it: from the nra.
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
you don’t make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great in the first place.
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
america must lead in a dangerous world, and our diplomats must continue representing us in dangerous places. 
if you are too dangerous to fly in america, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in america. 
if mr. trump gets his way, it'll be like christmas in the kremlin. it will make america less safe and the world more dangerous. 
let's make america a world leader in manufacturing, again.
it’s not complicated: if you are too dangerous to fly in america, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in america.  9-4e07-95ff-24616091234e …
when someone shows you who they are, believe them. trump has shown us who he is.  7-4918-886c-37cadedd9dd4 …
the immigrant story is america's story. that's why we need a real pathway to citizenship.
proud mom alert: love what you wrote about  , @chelseaclinton .  
a new dad wrote to hillary about his hopes for his family:
meet olivia, the 12-year-old feminist who wrote hillary this letter:
our criminal justice system is in crisis—but we can start changing that now.
we cannot go on with losing 90 people a day to gun violence...we need to take action now. 
america must continue to lead in a dangerous world—and we do so by exercising smart leadership grounded firmly in our values.
when we talk about the flint water crisis, we also have to talk about its root causes—economic, racial, and other.
we can’t let the student debt crisis continue. we’ve got to give hard-working students and families relief.
we cannot, must not, vilify police officers. remember what those officers were doing when they died. they were protecting a peaceful march.
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
tired of the  ? we asked supporters what they were doing instead. here were some of our favorites:
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
happy birthday, @potus .

cheers to you, @jimmyfallon . happy birthday!
a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapons.  on @realdonaldtrump

nobody in america should have to forgo a higher education because they can't afford it.
donald trump looks at women and decides how their looks rate on a scale of one to 10.
 @berniesanders , you’ve put economic and social justice issues front and center where they belong. 
"in america, every family should feel like they belong."
way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks. in america, if you can dream it, you should be able to do it. 
to be be great, we can’t be small. we can’t lose what made america great in the first place.

in this debate, we tried to deal with the very tough issues facing our country—in stark contrast to the republicans. 
donald trump is proud of his recklessness—that’s his business. but when he’s running for president, it’s ours.
donald trump is not who we are.
our criminal justice system is broken. here are 3 things we can do to start fixing it:
there is something wrong with our country. there is too much violence...too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn’t be.

president obama was born in the united states. he’s american. trump only has one reason for refusing to admit it.
"no major party nominee in the history of this nation has known less or been less prepared to deal with...national security" —biden on trump
laws that restrict access to abortion don’t make women less likely to seek it—they just make women less safe.
donald trump still refuses to admit president obama was born in the united states.

what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.
we need a president who will make quality higher education a reality for every american.
“even if people don’t vote for me in november, i’m going to be for them and for you every single day.”

a republican president would undo @potus ’ progress on climate, guns, immigration, and a whole lot more.
"president trump" would undo so much of the progress we’ve made over the past 8 years under president obama. we can't let that happen.

after everything we saw at the republican convention...being here with you on this beautiful day is like a breath of fresh air. 
donald trump actually stood on a debate stage in november and said that wages are too high in this country. 
rt if you are, too.
"we all agree that wages are too low and inequality is too high. that wall street can never again be allowed to threaten main street."
if you are too dangerous to fly in america, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in america. 
donald trump says wages are too high. really? hardworking americans don't think so.
here's what you need to know about trump's "university."
donald trump's business strategy: it's not about what you can build. it's about how much you can take.
"together we’re going to build an america where...a father can tell his daughter, 'you can be anything you want to be—including president.'"
if we aren't doing everything we can to prevent  , then we're not doing nearly enough.
everything you need to know before watching tonight's debate:
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
america is stronger because of president obama's leadership, and i am better because of his friendship.

these things can be true at once: we need criminal justice reform. we need to support police. we need to do more to stop gun violence.
we can’t afford a president trump, cruz, or kasich. we need a leader on women's rights.
we need a president who can take on republicans and get the job done.
we need a president who sees the best in all of us.

donald trump launched his campaign one year ago this week. and what a year it’s been.
high five: we just won alabama and tennessee.
i think the president's job is to do everything possible—everything she can do—to lift up the people of this country.

our next president needs to do everything possible to make life a little easier for working parents.
donald trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states.
the commander in chief must do everything she can to keep america safe—but military action should always be the last resort.

we will not rip families apart. we will defend @potus 's actions on immigration and go further to keep families together.
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
more and more, paying for college is pushing people’s dreams further out of reach–and that’s just wrong.
when it comes to terrorism, we know what doesn’t work (bluster and bigotry) and what does (steady leadership).
it’s not just that trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to national security. his words are dangerous, and they hurt us.
hillary at tonight’s  :
these things can be true at once: we need criminal justice reform. we need to support police. we need to do more to stop gun violence.
we need more love and kindness in this country...the last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are. 
instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers. we need to show that we really are all in this together.  in sc
we don't just need to pray...we need to act...republicans and the nra say, now is not the time to talk about guns. yes, it is. 
we need to work to make sure that we give every child in america the same opportunities.
some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs...i want it to be us. 
you know hillary's a candidate—but did you know she's also a  winner? more things you never knew about her:
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
how much do you know about the loopholes in our gun laws?
"i know more about isis than the generals do." —donald trump no, you don't.

as @flotus said, the choice in this election is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives.
we have a choice: elect a president with years of experience working with other leaders to keep the world safe, or not.
fifty years later, we have to recognize that this work isn't done. we have to make it easier for every citizen to vote—not harder. 
anyone who looks at the african american community and sees only poverty, crime, and despair is missing so much.
trump asked what the african american community has to lose by voting for him. @marlondmarshall 's response:
americans don’t say: “i alone can fix it.” we say: “ok, how are we going to fix this together?”
americans don’t say, 'i alone can fix it.' they say, ‘we’ll fix it together!’ 
hillary believes that what’s good for women is good for america.
no matter what @carlyfiorina says, paid family leave is good for women, good for families, and good for america.
the united states is the only country in the developed world without guaranteed paid leave. that has to change.

president obama was born in the united states. he’s american. trump only has one reason for refusing to admit it.
barack obama is president of the united states until january 20, 2017—that is a fact, whether the republicans like it or not. 
50 gop national security experts said they will not vote for trump because he would be “the most reckless president in american history.”
“i don’t think president obama & vice president biden get the credit they deserve for saving the american economy.”
fact: no major company has filed for chapter 11 more often in the last 30 years than @realdonaldtrump 's casinos.

under trump's tax plan, the wealthiest 0.1% of americans would get more tax relief than the bottom 60% combined.
what you're really hearing at the  : more tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, no real plans for the middle class.
trump wants to eliminate the estate tax. what that would mean: his family gets a $4 billion tax cut. 99.8% of americans get nothing.
we respect the choice the people of the united kingdom have made. 
donald trump's tax plan: 1. cut taxes for the wealthiest americans 2. saddle the rest of the country with the debt

we can’t cozy up to dictators; we have to stand up to them. we can’t contain isis; we must defeat it. and we will.
no child should ever have to grow up in poverty, yet far too many do. we have to do better. here's how:
we cannot keep imprisoning more people than anyone else in the world.
"we’re going to come back to philadelphia...with the most votes and the most pledged delegates. we’ll unify our party to win this election.”
so far we’ve received nearly 9 million votes—more than a million more than donald trump and 2.5 million more than senator sanders.
more than anyone, hillary knows that the decisions she will make as president affect me and my family.
as your president, i will always have your back. 
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
anyone asking for your vote has a responsibility to grapple with reality—to see things as they actually are, not just as we want them to be.

"we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values...that is not who we are as americans. we are better than that."
we can’t cozy up to dictators; we have to stand up to them. we can’t contain isis; we must defeat it. and we will.
we are americans. we will not turn on each other or our principles. that's how we win.
politics are hard. but when it comes to gun violence, we cannot give up. we cannot sit by while more good people die. we must keep going.
trump’s hateful comments aren’t just an affront to our values—they’re a threat to our national security.

if donald trump doesn't show all americans the respect they deserve, he doesn't deserve to be their president.
the world is a better place because hillary was secretary of state. here’s why:
world leaders on why hillary's tenure as secretary of state prepared her to be president:
a small change made by hillary during her tenure as secretary of state had a big impact for transgender americans.
as secretary of state, hillary led the international negotiations that paved the way for the iran deal.
what did hillary accomplish as secretary of state? @senschumer weighs in:
as your president, i will always have your back. 
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.

after the events in paris and with thousands of gun deaths in the us each year, hard to fathom this from the gop.  
hope you have this much fun this weekend.
the fact that trump's answer to a question about racial injustice is just "we need law and order" pretty much says it all.
"some days" we're pretty proud of.
this choice is pretty straightforward.
the choice on jobs is pretty clear: see how your state would fare under hillary vs. trump.
if you were president, how would you spend $4 billion? (one guess as to trump's answer:  )
hard to believe they spent so much time talking about me and no time talking about jobs or education or health care.  on the rnc
barack& michelle& joe& bernie& elizabeth& you?
"if you would like help with your campaign, i am available and i would work for candy."
donald trump’s tax plan would give $3.2 trillion to millionaires & billionaires. ted cruz would give them even more. we can't afford that.
one candidate would stand up for workers and their families. the other? not so much.
under trump, our economy would lose 3.5 million jobs. hillary's plan would create 10.4 million—in one term alone.
if trump wants to talk about debt, let’s start with the $34 trillion (that's a "t") his tax plan would run up.

donald trump doesn't seem to actually care about making america great so much as he seems to care about making himself look great.

donald trump’s campaign adds up to an ugly, dangerous message to america. a message that you should be afraid. 
let us be vigilant, but not afraid…we choose resolve, not fear. we will not turn on each other or undermine each other. 
"what part of democracy are all these candidates afraid of?" read why hillary is fighting to protect voting rights.

remember: if he becomes president, donald trump would have the . economy in his hands.
if you were president, how would you spend $4 billion? (one guess as to trump's answer:  )
how much more money would you have if you didn’t have student loan debt?
trump wants to eliminate the estate tax. it would save the trump family $4 billion, but it would do nothing for 99.8% of americans.
the . economy would have produced an additional $447.6 billion in 2013 if women received equal pay.

just 30% of girls around the world are enrolled in secondary school. together, we can change that:
there's only one candidate in this election who's ready to be america's commander-in-chief.
20 years ago, women made 72 cents on the dollar to men. today it's still just 77 cents. more work to do.

“atlantic city was a very good cash cow for me for a long time...the money i took out of there was incredible.” —donald trump
what donald trump did in atlantic city is nothing to brag about—it’s shameful—and every voter in america needs to know about it.
the trump marina hotel casino in atlantic city was sold just a few years ago at a huge loss.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
we can't let trump bankrupt america like we're one of his casinos. watch hillary live from atlantic city →
trump: "i love war, in a certain way."
we have the most productive workers in the world. we just need to give our people a chance to succeed:
this country belongs to all of us—not just to those at the top. not just to people who look one way, worship one way, or even think one way.
we have the most productive and competitive workers in the world. we just need to give them a chance to succeed.
yeah, @berniesanders —she's got a *bit* of experience.
these candidates don't seem to mind a "big government" when it's politicians interfering in women's personal health decisions.
military action should be the last resort—not the first choice. 
"she has so much compassion and it shows. she's a person, she's a grandmother, she's somebody's mother."
how can you tell hillary will fight every day for kids and families? because it's what she's always done.
he’s always doing that.
“as president, she won’t just say she’s going to do something. she will follow through and actually do it.”
what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
this country belongs to all of us—not just to those at the top. not just to people who look one way, worship one way, or even think one way.
trump isn’t just incoherent; he’s dangerous. he’s not just unprepared; he’s temperamentally unfit to be commander-in-chief.
tim is everything donald trump & mike pence are not…he is a progressive who likes to get things done. that’s just my kind of guy. 
"he is a progressive who likes to get things done. that’s just my kind of guy." –hillary on @timkaine

it's outrageous that students are being asked to pay interest rates higher than you would pay to buy a house.  c-49e2-b1f8-31569a95f4ff …
lower interest rates never pay more than you can afford hillary’s plan will relieve the burden of student debt:
no family should have to pay more than 10% of its income on child care.
do you think donald trump is qualified to be president? — @chriscuomo no, i do not. 
donald trump is not who we are.
donald trump's tax plan would add $30 trillion to the national debt over 20 years. that's "trillion"—with a "t."
hillary is joining tom joyner on the @tjmshow ! tune in →
the affordable care act is working—and it's too important to repeal.
donald trump is not who we are.
donald trump has no actual plan to create jobs.
here's what people with actual "tremendous business success" say about donald trump.
only one candidate in this election has actual plans to help middle-class families:
i want the public to see my email. i asked state to release them. they said they will review them for release as soon as possible.
donald trump's foundation: paying off would-be opponents, stiffing actual charities.
republicans say they don’t think hillary has accomplished anything—so she sent them a gift.
when kids are scared by political candidates and policy debates, it’s a sign something has gone badly wrong. 
hillary just became the first woman ever to win the  .
"as president, i’ll fight to put families first—just like i have my entire career."
proud to have senator reid on this team.
trump's plan wouldn't just cut taxes for rich people—it would raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
trump's plan: cut taxes for billionaires & millionaires like him. raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
a key difference between the two candidates at the  last night:
icymi: watch hillary's keynote speech from @womenintheworld .
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
a lesson from hillary's mom: "life's not about what happens to you. it's about what you do with what happens to you—so get back out there."
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.
no matter who you are, what you look like, what faith you practice, or who you love: she’s fighting for you.  7-4a03-8d06-a03c15b9c111 …
if you could tell hillary why you're on her team, what would you say?
i want the public to see my email. i asked state to release them. they said they will review them for release as soon as possible.
seven reasons the world is a better place because hillary was secretary of state:
we have to build on the affordable care act and continue our march toward making sure every single american has health coverage.
“even if people don’t vote for me in november, i’m going to be for them and for you every single day.”
donald trump’s not just wrong about judge curiele’s wrong about america. he’s wrong about what makes this country great.
good morning, new hampshire! see you at the polls.
hillary's first fight: "make the economy work for everyday americans, not just those at the top."
hillary will defend president obama’s executive actions on immigration—and if congress refuses to act, do everything possible to go further.
we need labor law reform. the  would protect workers' rights, now congress should pass it. 
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
"i do wish donald would listen to other people once in a while. he might actually learn something. but...he only listens to himself."
what he did here in atlantic city is exactly what he’ll do if he wins in november.  on @realdonaldtrump :
no matter what donald says at tonight's debate, we already know the real trump. follow @thebriefing2016 for the facts.
no matter what donald trump says, america is great, and the american dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise.
no matter what @carlyfiorina says, paid family leave is good for women, good for families, and good for america.
we're not going to round up millions of immigrants and deport them—no matter how many times trump says he wants to.  5-4c51-8bbd-fd80b2c3c61b …
no matter how great the challenge, america must lead.  to the @americanlegion
q: "saying [a judge] can't do his job because of his race—is that not the definition of racism?" trump: "no."
a feminist is by definition someone who believes in equal rights. 
even @speakerryan called trump’s comments on judge curiel, “the textbook definition of a racist comment.”
do you think donald trump is qualified to be president? — @chriscuomo no, i do not. 
if the young women of this country have donald trump as their president, what will they think of themselves?

when we talk about the outrage happening in flint, it's important to talk about who lives there.
when we talk about criminal justice reform, we also have to talk about jobs, education, and housing.
so great to see @billclinton taking  on the road to india to talk about women in the economy.
when we talk about the flint water crisis, we also have to talk about its root causes—economic, racial, and other.

if you're with hillary, now is the time to stand up and say so. if you can, pitch in to show her you’re with her:
you’re the reason we’re here. you’re the reason we’re going to win this nomination and then win this election.  in nh

i accept your nomination for president of the united states! 
president obama was born in the united states. he’s american. trump only has one reason for refusing to admit it.
for the first time in our history, a woman will be a major party’s nominee for president of the united states.
no one can get this done alone—not even the president of the united states. it’s got to be the mission of our entire nation.
"the united states needs to lead in the americas. and if we don't, make no mistake—others will."
trump retweets white nationalists. he talks about banning muslims. and yes, he talks about curtailing press freedom as well.

the ultimate test of our society is how we treat our fellow human beings, especially those who we have previously left behind.
let’s not forget that there are lots of flints out there. places where poor people and people of color have been left out and left behind.
we have to do more to support people with alzheimer's, and the families that care for them.

small businesses are the backbone of our economy. we should focus on supporting them—not stiffing them.
"he preyed on...people who had fallen on hard times. he’s conned them, he’s defrauded them, and he’s ripped them off.” —warren on trump

trump's calling for trillion dollar tax cuts for wall street. it's time for them to pay their fair share.
this is why i do it and this is who i’m in it for—to make life better for children and families. 
donald trump wants to spend $3 trillion (yes, with a t) on tax cuts for people like him.
it's wrong that millionaires get more tax cuts while families are facing barriers to success. this election is a chance to make it right.
what you're really hearing at the  : more tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, no real plans for the middle class.
. @realdonaldtrump : “i’m the last person she wants to run against."
we don’t want to turn against each other. we want to work with one another. we want to set big goals in this country.
i want this election to be about something, not just against somebody.  in iowa:

"president trump" would undo so much of the progress we’ve made over the past 8 years under president obama. we can't let that happen.
a republican president would undo @potus ’ progress on climate, guns, immigration, and a whole lot more.
trump's candidacy is built on his business "credibility." but his business record matches his character: his only concern is his own profit.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
“i have this old-fashioned notion that if you’re running for president, you should say what you’re going to do.”
to every little girl who dreams big: yes, you can be anything you want—even president. tonight is for you. 
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
everything you need to know before watching tonight's debate:
americans with disabilities deserve the chance to work alongside those without disabilities—to do the same jobs for the same pay & benefits.
trump's rhetoric is shameful. it was one thing when he was a reality tv personality. it’s another when he’s running for president.
thank you, @potus .

bye for now, iowa, & thank you! i loved talking to so many of you about what’s on your mind & your ideas for the future. see you soon! 
to everyone who's ever been bullied for being who you are: you're perfect, and i'm proud of you.  
i accept your nomination for president of the united states! 
president obama was born in the united states. he’s american. trump only has one reason for refusing to admit it.
donald trump still refuses to admit president obama was born in the united states.
we cannot afford to have a republican succeed barack obama as president of the united states.
donald trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states.
hillary: ”the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top, and we need to shuffle the cards. we need to play a different hand."
i'm running for president. everyday americans need a champion, and i want to be that champion. –h
hillary: a champion for women’s rights.
this is why i do it and this is who i’m in it for—to make life better for children and families.

the other side is not talking issues—they're talking insults.

"what i heard in those early days has stuck with me." hillary on the first 10 months of the campaign:
i will bring law enforcement and communities together to develop national guidelines on the use of force by police officers. 
we need strategies to fight crime & restore trust between law enforcement and our communities, especially communities of color.
end mass incarceration. address inequality. restore trust between law enforcement & communities. read this & share:
we cannot, must not, vilify police officers. remember what those officers were doing when they died. they were protecting a peaceful march.
taking on systemic racism and rebuilding trust and respect between law enforcement and the communities they serve will require all of us.
this 19-year-old voter in new hampshire was on the fence until he heard @billclinton speak on hillary's experience.
hillary is fighting for all of us.
what happened in flint would never have happened in a wealthy, white suburb of detroit. 
watch what happened when our youngest volunteer got to work at campaign hq.
hillary on the flint water crisis: "would it have happened if they were rich and white instead of poor and black?"
what happened in north carolina is the latest reminder that the fight for lgbt equality is far from over.
here’s what happened when a strong bernie sanders supporter asked hillary a question at a town hall:
the american auto industry just had its best year ever. so yes, we can bring american manufacturing back.
the number of american lives lost to gun violence is more than three times the rate as the next developed country.
...and many of them pay a lower tax rate.
the uninsured rate is the lowest in decades, but prescription costs, out-of-pocket costs, and premiums are growing. we need to do better.
america needs leadership in the white house, not a liability.
the president is also the commander in chief. only one candidate has the experience, judgment, and plans to keep us safe.
i’m proud of the experience and judgment i would bring to this job. a president has to be able to do all parts of the job. 
if you’re proud to stand with hillary all the way to the white house, chip in $1 to help her get there:
when there’s a democrat in the white house, america creates more jobs, the economy grows faster, and deficits are smaller. 
hillary's videographer on what it's like to follow her around the country with a camera:
congressional trifecta against women today: 1) blocking great nominee, 1st african american woman ag, for longer than any ag in 30 years…
a great day to hit the campaign trail in ohio with @elizabethforma .
if you see a bully, stand up to him.
the great recession hit our whole country hard, but the toll was especially hard on black and latino families.
as your president, i will always have your back. 
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is. 
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump.

"you know, before it was called obamacare, it was called hillarycare."
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.
nobody here was “having fun” except for trump.

if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done.

“i have this old-fashioned notion that if you’re running for president, you should say what you’re going to do.”

there are just 39 days between now & november 8. just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.
repeating the specific words 'radical islamic terrorism' is just a distraction...our priority should be how to fight the enemy. 
trump has made a big show of supposedly supporting veterans. in reality, he's done the exact opposite.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.

we should build a path to citizenship, not a wall on the border.

republicans are refusing to act on climate change. hillary has a plan to take it on.
we need a president who can take on republicans and get the job done.
4 reasons we can't let republicans take their attacks on planned parenthood and women's rights to the white house:
americans [are] telling us about their struggles…they want to be given a chance, a fighting chance.  live from chicago
we must take action on climate change.
not one living president has said they believe donald trump has what it takes to be commander-in-chief.
this isn't who we are, and it also isn't how we keep america safe.
"there is more to do, and no administration can do it alone. congress has to be our partner as it has been after previous tragedies."
americans need a president who has what it takes to get the job done.
trump prioritizing his own gain over americans' well-being isn't new, but it is telling: the only person he'll fight for is himself.

hillary at tonight’s  :
"it’s way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job—and women of color making even less."

america is stronger because of president obama's leadership, and i am better because of his friendship. 
you don’t have to be a scientist to know that climate change is an urgent challenge that threatens us all. we need to act.
we cannot sit by while more people die.

we know donald trump is not who we are. if you want to shut him down, then let’s vote him down.
the same people [trump's] trying to get to vote for him now are people he’s been exploiting for years :
grateful to @martin_dempsey for long and distinguished service to our nation. it was an honor to work with him to keep our country safe. 
the trump university con says a lot about trump. if you can't trust him with your personal financesow can we trust him with our country?

we should treat the caretakers who serve 11 million americans with serious medical needs like the heroes they are.
drug and alcohol addiction is a disease, not a moral failing—and we must treat it as such.

it’s a simple but powerful idea. we are fairer together. we are better together. we are stronger together.
we have to decide whether we’re going to work together so we can all rise together. 
any candidate seriously competing to be president should seriously campaign everywhere. that’s what we’ve done.
"we may have a record-setting turnout in this election. we could have the biggest turnout we've ever had."

this shouldn't have to be said: you don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. it doesn’t work. no one buys it.
if you could tell hillary why you're on her team, what would you say?
we did it, south carolina.
this is big. we just won florida!
a little encouragement from dad can go a long way. from natalie in florida:
the threats we face are real. the next president will take office in a year—and he or she needs a real plan to defeat terrorism.
as president, i will stand up to china and anyone else who tries to take advantage of american workers and companies. 
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
donald trump says he wants to make america great again—well, he could start by actually making things in america again.

we should build a path to citizenship, not a wall on the border.

no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.
thanks for having our back, kentucky.
when we talk about criminal justice reform, we also have to talk about jobs, education, and housing.
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.
anyone who wants to be president of this country should have a real plan to raise incomes, create jobs, and improve our economy.
when we talk about the outrage happening in flint, it's important to talk about who lives there.
when we talk about the flint water crisis, we also have to talk about its root causes—economic, racial, and other.
the only thing standing between donald trump and the oval office is all of us. 
a year from now, a new president will walk into the oval office. we can't afford to let it be a republican.
with a mother in the oval office, we may finally catch up to the rest of the world on paid leave.
donald trump in the oval office is flat-out dangerous. we can’t let it happen.

trump and his hateful language are affecting our kids. these are some of the heartbreaking things they're saying:
trump is right about one thing.
we've got to keep going, keep working, keep breaking down those barriers and imagine what we can build together.
agreed, president @billclinton !
there is no other donald trump. this is it.
big win for those who think we should make it easier, not harder, to vote (which really should be all of us).  
this is why i do it and this is who i’m in it for—to make life better for children and families. 
trump uses his foundation to pay for things with other people's money.
we will not build a wall—instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one. 
if we do the work, we will 'cease to be divided.' we will be indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
a wall that mexico will pay for: a bad idea from an even worse negotiator.
when we work together, we will trump hate.

the gop's ideas for the economy are just trickle-down economics in disguise. we need a new plan for the 21st century.

16 million americans have gained health insurance from the affordable care act. we need to protect it—not repeal it.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
stop the raids. stop the round ups. stop the deporting.
people all over america are sending texts to iowa (and you can too!).
donald trump still refuses to say @potus was born in america. and this man wants to be our president? when will he stop this ugliness?
under @potus and @joebiden : ✓ our businesses created 15 million new jobs. ✓ 20 million people have health care.
if we aren't doing everything we can to prevent  , then we're not doing nearly enough.
he’s always doing that.
if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
thoughts and prayers aren’t enough—we must act to protect families from gun violence.

just 98 days until election day. here are 98 things that depend on the choice we make on november 8:
we can’t hide from hard truths about race and justice.
trump's statements are lies—but he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.
"trump, the self-proclaimed tough negotiator, not only choked but openly lied about choking."
to be be great, we can’t be small. we can’t lose what made america great in the first place.
to be great, we can't be small. we have to be as big as the values that define america. 
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.

to every little girl who dreams big: yes, you can be anything you want—even president. tonight is for you. 
from the bottom of my heart: thank you, iowa.

5 days to iowa!
this country belongs to all of us—not just to those at the top. not just to people who look one way, worship one way, or even think one way.

bye for now, iowa, & thank you! i loved talking to so many of you about what’s on your mind & your ideas for the future. see you soon! 
your student debt collector would really like you not to vote for hillary.
what happened in flint would never have happened in a wealthy, white suburb of detroit. 
i'm running for president. everyday americans need a champion, and i want to be that champion. –h
trump is right about one thing.
let’s make sure our future is in the right hands.
we need to pay our teachers like the future of our country is in their hands—because it is.

a 12-year-old feminist named olivia wrote hillary this brave, heartwarming letter. olivia 2040, anybody?
some good advice from hillary.
here's what you need to know about trump's "university."
donald trump's business strategy: it's not about what you can build. it's about how much you can take.
"together we’re going to build an america where...a father can tell his daughter, 'you can be anything you want to be—including president.'"
if we aren't doing everything we can to prevent  , then we're not doing nearly enough.
the boys are right. we need everyone's help to get the planet moving in the right direction.
when americans get knocked down, we get right back up again. we refuse to quit—no matter what. that’s the spirit we need in this election.
we’ll rely on organizations in our community, because adam will need training, direction & safety as an adult.

everything we need to do in our country really starts with how we treat our children.  in nh. watch live:
gender equality and economic equality go hand in hand. you can't fight for one without understanding the other.
i am humbled and moved by the republicans who are willing to stand up and say that donald trump does not represent their values. 
the next president has to be able to stand up to republicans and stop their backward agenda.
if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
turns out, hosting miss universe pageants abroad doesn't equate to diplomatic skills.
who gets up at 3 o'clock in the morning to engage in a twitter attack against a former miss universe?

thanks, pittsburgh. it was an unqualified delight.
when you work hard, you should not be living in poverty.
anyone who looks at the african american community and sees only poverty, crime, and despair is missing so much.
anybody working full-time should not be living in poverty. it’s time to raise the minimum wage.
we have to take on broader inequities in society—you can’t separate unrest in the streets from cycles of poverty & despair in communities.
we need to raise the minimum wage, lift millions of families out of poverty, and make the economy work for everyone.

nobody here was “having fun” except for trump.
a man who talks about our veterans and military families like this doesn't deserve to be commander-in-chief.

how do you know hillary will fight for equal pay? she's been doing it for years. learn about her record and ideas:
we can make families stronger by cutting taxes, raising the minimum wage, and making sure women get equal pay for equal work.
. @realdonaldtrump glad you'll be watching. it's going to be "huge."
a real headline about the republican nominee: "trump used $258,000 from his charity to settle legal problems."
hard to believe they spent so much time talking about me and no time talking about jobs or education or health care.  on the rnc
he says women will start making equal pay as soon as they do as good a job as men—as if we aren’t already.  on @realdonaldtrump
someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump. 
judge curiel is as much of an american as i am, and he's as much of an american as donald trump is.

no, barack obama is not the founder of isis.
the "winners" from last night's  :
we can’t do any of these things without your help. our future is on the ballot. let's prove that  :
hillary on the situation in  .
trump says, “i love playing with debt.” someone should tell him our economy isn’t a game.
i love this country. i’m proud of this country. i want to be a leader who brings people together. 
to be be great, we can’t be small. we can’t lose what made america great in the first place.
what the world needs now is love.
as your president, i will always have your back. 
strengthening unions doesn’t just serve their members—it leads to better pay, benefits, and working conditions for all employees.

if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
“i have this old-fashioned notion that if you’re running for president, you should say what you’re going to do.”
hillary on the faith that drives her: "do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can."
we know donald trump is not who we are. if you want to shut him down, then let’s vote him down.
. @realdonaldtrump : condoning violence against protesters and press at your rallies is the real disgrace.

"it’s true: i sweat the details of policy...because it’s not just a detail if it’s your kid, if it’s your family. it’s a big deal."
way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks. in america, if you can dream it, you should be able to do it. 
we need more love and kindness in this country...the last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are. 
the american people have always made this country great.
on foreign policy, the use of force should always be the last resort—not the first choice. 
true on foreign policy—and literally everything else.
donald trump's foreign policy isn't just offensive, it's dangerous.
the work of chris stevens and his colleagues represented the best of this approach to foreign policy.
this is what a comprehensive (not "secret") counterterrorism plan looks like.

"trump says he would run our country like he has run his businesses. well, i’m from jersey...we see how he leads in atlantic city.” —booker
this dad is doing everything he can to make this country a better place for his daughters. read his letter to them:
donald trump could bankrupt america like he bankrupted his companies. let's make sure he never gets the chance:
trump says he won’t tell anyone what he’ll do about isis because he wants to keep his plan “secret.” well, the secret is he has no plan.
president obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he got done. 
the next president has to be able to stand up to republicans and stop their backward agenda.

we need a president who can do all aspects of the job...i'm ready to take it on. 
he’s always doing that.
there is something wrong with our country. there is too much violence...too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn’t be.

here's an easy way to help hillary win in new hampshire—it only takes 5 minutes!
we’re building this organization across the country, from the grassroots up. be a part of it:
for the first time in our history, a woman will be a major party’s nominee for president of the united states.
i'm told the number just ticked over: as of a few minutes ago, 1,000,000 people have pitched in to be a part of this campaign. thank you. 
the "winners" from last night's  :
trump: "i love war, in a certain way."
"i know more about isis than the generals do." —donald trump no, you don't.
had enough? do something about it:
carly fiorina challenged democrats to name an accomplishment of hillary’s. @senatorleahy accepted:
even in states with strict gun laws, illegal weapons are often just a bus ride away. we have to fix this:
it’s time to act on gun violence.
i will take on the gun lobby for commonsense gun safety reform. :
there's only one candidate on stage who thinks gun makers should be held accountable for gun deaths.
“it's time we stand up to the gun lobby and stand with parents who have lost their children to gun violence.”
the first  results are in: we won georgia and virginia!

welcome to the team, @timkaine .
advice for kids: dress for the job you want.
some good advice from hillary.
when donald trump's casinos failed, hundreds of people lost their jobs, but he walked away with millions.
happy national dog day!
let's review the record.
he’s always doing that.
republicans say the world doesn't respect us. the world disagrees.

in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
if you see bigotry, you should oppose it. if you see violence, you should condemn it. if you see a bully, you should stand up to him.

this is why i do it and this is who i’m in it for—to make life better for children and families. 
so if fighting for women is playing the  , well...
we need to pay our teachers like the future of our country is in their hands—because it is.
i’ve been called a lot of things over the years, but ‘unqualified’ has not been one of them. 
donald trump might have gone decades without paying taxes—but he’s not afraid of telling other people to pay theirs.
now might be a good time to follow us on snapchat.
they don't have to be for me. i will be for them.  on voters who might not support her.

i will not quit on you. i will fight for you. i will be there for you every single day. (via @hillaryforia )
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done.

had enough? do something about it:
"we should be saying that enough is enough.” read hillary's plan to address america’s substance use epidemic:
we need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals.  on the fl attack
we don’t need to make america great again. america never stopped being great. but we do need to make america whole again.  in sc
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
one positive thing trump could do to make america great again? actually make great things in america:
trump says he wants to "make america great again," but his real message remains “make america hate again.”

7 ways donald trump proved he’s not ready to be commander-in-chief (in less than 30 minutes):
"it’s way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job—and women of color making even less."
anybody who thinks that they can influence what i will do doesn't know me very well. 
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, for as long as you can.
do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.
now we know what trump really thinks about us. sad!
donald trump is not who we are.
i will never, ever disrespect gold star families who’ve made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation or prisoners of war. 
our fallen heroes deserve our profound gratitude for giving their lives to protect our freedom, today and every day.  
gold star families like betsy’s have paid the ultimate price for our freedom. they deserve our eternal thanks.  2-4aee-a939-8ba3f3959e79 …
grateful to @martin_dempsey for long and distinguished service to our nation. it was an honor to work with him to keep our country safe. 
we have a sacred responsibility to those who serve and sacrifice for this country—today we remember and honor the values they fought for. 
trump's plan wouldn't just cut taxes for rich people—it would raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
trump's plan: cut taxes for billionaires & millionaires like him. raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
paying zero in taxes doesn’t make you "smart." it makes you a tax evader.
we need to make it easier for parents to balance the demands of work and family.

donald trump's business strategy: it's not about what you can build. it's about how much you can take.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from—you deserve a president who will fight for you.
donald trump is not who we are.

wish mom could have been here to see tonight.
i don't want to see us start over again. i want us to defend and build on the affordable care act and improve it. 
donald trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the united states.
donald trump is totally unfit and unqualified to be president of the united states:
we cannot afford to have a republican succeed barack obama as president of the united states.
americans are hungry for solutions. they don’t just want us to diagnose problems, they want us to solve them.
happy national dog day!
what trump just did is a disgrace.
this young man’s story about depression is exactly why we can’t repeal or replace the affordable care act.

someone as detached from reality as donald trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump.

in exactly one year, we’ll make history—or turn back the clock on the progress we've made.
said it before, will say it again: bluster and chest-beating aren't a strategy to defeat terrorism.
no questions at  , but we'll say it now: the women of america deserve a champion in the white house.
we face serious challenges in the world—but americans will not turn on each other, turn on our allies, or turn away from our principles.
i’m running for president to make our economy work for you and for every american. it's your time. let's do this together. 
every republican senator running for president voted against making it harder for suspected terrorists to get a gun.
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done. 
hope you have this much fun this weekend.
we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.
"if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. and when you get ahead, america gets ahead."
new yorkers have always believed that if you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. 
i want every young person in america to know that if you work hard, you can get ahead, and i want america to have your back. in nh

a bernie sanders supporter asked hillary a questionere’s what he thought of her response:

"don’t attack women’s health care. and don’t shut down the government." hillary's message to republicans:
the senate was right to block a resolution that would defund planned parenthood. now, stop these attacks—and don't shut down the government.
this country belongs to all of us—not just to those at the top. not just to people who look one way, worship one way, or even think one way.

what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
marriage equality is the law of the land. deal with it.
tearing up the iran nuclear deal isn't leadership—it's recklessness.
as secretary of state, hillary led the international negotiations that paved the way for the iran deal.
trump's candidacy is built on his business "credibility." but his business record matches his character: his only concern is his own profit.
hillary in new york yesterday:

i’m running for president to make our economy work for you and for every american. it's your time. let's do this together. 
however you serve, it feels great to be a part of something bigger than yourself—to work toward making something good happen in the world.
let's put the dream of starting and running a thriving small business within reach of every american.
we need leaders...who put the interests of the american people ahead of their personal business interests.  at
the brave men and women who have served our country deserve better than donald trump.
a president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country. 
on veterans day, to all who have served—you deserve our gratitude, respect, and the best care and benefits in the world. 
“everyone who has served deserves our thanks...and you deserve a country and a president and commander-in-chief who honors your service."
“to all our veterans, and the men and women now serving: you represent the very best that our country has to offer.”  d-452a-a665-77a8b5881afa …
we need to pay our teachers like the future of our country is in their hands—because it is.
we are going to end the federal government making money off of lending money to get your education.
we don't all look the same, or sound the same, or worship the same—and that's one of america's biggest strengths.  b-41d7-98c6-5f5c7d40fd83 …
new york is home to 20 million people. we don’t all look the same. we don’t all sound the same or worship the same, but we pull together.
americans with disabilities deserve the chance to work alongside those without disabilities—to do the same jobs for the same pay & benefits.
if you're looking for someone to say what is wrong with america, i'm not your candidate. i think there is more right than wrong. 
as a smart man once said, there’s nothing wrong with america that can’t be fixed by what is right with america. 
. @madeleine there must be something in the water @wellesley .
all of the other issues we want to deal with depend on our country being secure and strong. 
we don’t want to turn against each other. we want to work with one another. we want to set big goals in this country.
we can’t cozy up to dictators; we have to stand up to them. we can’t contain isis; we must defeat it. and we will.
one candidate would help millions of hardworking americans. the other would only help those at the top.

our teachers deserve more than just a pat on the back. they deserve a raise.
if trump had his way, the federal minimum wage would be $0.
hardworking americans deserve a raise. it’s time to increase the minimum wage:
we’ve got to do more to raise families’ incomes. we can start by raising the federal minimum wage. 
$7.25 an hour is a starvation wage. so sorry donald, if you’re watching, we’re not cutting the minimum wage, we’re raising the minimum wage.
. @govchristie , vetoing a minimum wage increase is a blow to working families. no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty. 
if you’re running for president, you should say what you want to do, how you’re going to pay for it, and how you’ll get it done.

no matter what @carlyfiorina says, paid family leave is good for women, good for families, and good for america.
hillary believes that what’s good for women is good for america.

the people taking care of our children and our parents deserve a good wage, good benefits, and a secure retirement.
some good advice from hillary.

you don’t make america great by getting rid of everything that made america great in the first place.
don’t let anyone tell you that america isn’t great. donald trump’s got america all wrong.
"we know we’ve got work to do. it's not to make america great again—america never stopped being great. we have to make america whole."
donald trump has proven over and over again that he's unfit to be our commander-in-chief.
hillary will fight to make it easier to vote—not harder.

donald trump’s campaign adds up to an ugly, dangerous message to america. a message that you should be afraid.

president obama’s successor cannot and will not be the man who led the racist birther movement. period.
"clinton is one of the brightest people in congress & she would be an excellent choice” —sen. sanders on hillary as sec. of state, nov. 2008
we're facing a candidate with a history of discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, and led the birther movement.
hillary has fought for women her whole life—and she's just getting started.
we know who donald is. for five years, he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president. 
america and our allies—especially israel—will be safer if we enforce the nuclear agreement with iran.
their faces say it all.
this is just common sense. it's time for congress to act.
tonight's  made it clear: we cannot afford a republican in the white house. get your free sticker:
the president is also the commander in chief. only one candidate has the experience, judgment, and plans to keep us safe.
profit sharing is just common sense. see hillary's plan:
the candidates on stage talk tough—but they won't even support legislation preventing suspected terrorists from getting guns.
nobody's attacking the second amendment. we can protect americans' rights—and also protect families from gun violence.
an overwhelming majority of americans (and gun owners) support steps to reduce gun violence. rt if you're one of them.
"he said i’ll abolish the 2nd amendment. wrong. he said i’ll let a flood of refugees into our country without any screening. also wrong."
there have been approximately 2,800 gun deaths since the last  one month ago. we can't wait any longer to act on gun violence.

we need to face up to the reality of systemic racism and then work to dismantle it.
hillary on the gop debates: "it's reality tv—with a cast of characters who don't care much about actual reality."
donald trump's business strategy: it's not about what you can build. it's about how much you can take.
for donald trump, it's not about what he can build —it's about how much he can take.
we have to face the world as it is but commit ourselves to turning it into what it should be.

the threat that donald trump poses is so dramatic to our country, to our democracy.  on @cnn
fixing our immigration system will strengthen families, our economy, and our country.
this threat is real, but so is our resolve. americans will not cower. we will prevail. 
we need to pay our teachers like the future of our country is in their hands—because it is.
our next president has to be just as passionate about defending our people and our country as about fixing our economy.

donald trump has spent years peddling lies about president obama. and that didn't stop today.
america needs leadership in the white house, not a liability.
the lesson of our history, through good times and hard times, is that we’re stronger together. 
my view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead.  in florida

we can't let these two anywhere near the white house.
start spreading the news.
while families are struggling to pay for child care, donald trump actually argued that americans are being paid too much.
addiction is a disease—not a moral failing. we should support those who are struggling with it.
the same people [trump's] trying to get to vote for him now are people he’s been exploiting for years :
"in america, every family should feel like they belong."
if gop attacks on @ppfa feel like an assault on women's health, it's because they are.

"i want to give our kids a safer world...that means a world with strong allies, more friends, fewer enemies, and fewer nuclear weapons."
reproductive freedom should be a reality for all, not a luxury for those who can afford it. i'll never give up until it is.  
i’m running for president to make our economy work for you and for every american. it's your time. let's do this together. 
donald trump might have gone decades without paying taxes—but he’s not afraid of telling other people to pay theirs.
paying for college doesn't end at tuition, so we need to help students pay for other costs like books and housing.
every day, donald trump proves that he’s not in this for the american people. he’s in it for himself. 
"i believe we have to build a 'growth and fairness' economy. you can’t have one without the other."

not a single living president has endorsed donald trump.

i will say what donald trump won’t: judge curiel is as american as i am and as american as donald trump.

there’s only one candidate who will defend and build on the progress we've made.

it is not enough to contain isis—we must defeat isis. break its momentum, and then its back. 
hillary is fighting for all of us.
like all americans, my thoughts are with those who were wounded, their families, & our first responders  on this weekend’s attacks
nurses care for our families like their own. it's time we returned the favor.
here's how hillary's fighting to make the economy work for all americans—not just those at the top:
it’s clearer than ever that this may be the most consequential election of our lifetimes.
if you think hillary is the best person to be president, chip in $1:
young americans have the most to gain from hillary's economic plan—and the most to lose under trump's policies.

trump's plan wouldn't just cut taxes for rich people—it would raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
trump's plan: cut taxes for billionaires & millionaires like him. raise taxes for millions of middle-class families.
it's easy to diagnose the problem. it's harder to do something about the problem.  on combating climate change
hillary is the only candidate on stage who has pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class.
i will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. 
when it comes to preventing gun violence, we cannot give up.
in america if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead—no matter who you are or where you started out.
