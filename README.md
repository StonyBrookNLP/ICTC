The goal of this project is to create an Integratively Complex Text Composer (ICTC) that takes articles containing multiple points of view, and generates an integrative text article that incorporates the multiple viewpoints.

What we have as of today is a trained LSTM sequence to sequence model and a frontend to it that takes as input a sentence from one side of an opinionated topic and returns an opposing sentence from the other side.
